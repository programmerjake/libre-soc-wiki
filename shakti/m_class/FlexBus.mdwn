# FlexBus

FlexBus is capable of emulating the 8080-style / ATI MCU Bus, as well as
providing support for access to SRAM.  It is extremely likely that it will
provide access to MCU-style Ethernet PHY ICs such as the DM9000, the
AX88180 (gigabit ethernet but an enormous number of pins), the AX88796A
(8/16-bit 80186 or MC68k).
