\frame{\frametitle{Why, How, What?}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Why? Because these days it's just not necessary to
         make [un]ethical compromises in order to make a profitable,
         desirable mass-volume product\\
         {\it (There's enough companies doing that: where it's got us??)}
   \item How? By leveraging the long-establised strategic cost and
         maintenance benefits of libre-licensed software (and
         HDL) and
         {\it making sure that the people who provide it are
         financially rewarded}.  Also by empowering diverse team
         collaboration
   \item What? A 2.5ghz RISC-V 64-bit SoC that has
		 a 3D Embedded GPU, 1080p Video decode, and interfaces
		 to make it attractive for use in tablets, netbooks, industrial
		 embedded and more.  22nm or less, under 400 pins, under USD \$4.\\
  {\it All sounds obvious... but is it practical and achievable?}
  \end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Definitions}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item {\bf Business}: the provision of a service and being
		 commensurately financially rewarded for doing so
   \item {\bf Spongeing}: the provision of a service and being
		  taken advantage of for doing so {\it (cf: Professor Yunus)}
	\item {\bf An ethical act}: an act that increases truth,
		  love, awareness or creativity for one or more people
		  (including yourself), {\it without} reducing those
		  same four qualities {\it for anyone}
	\item {\bf The Four Freedoms}: the rights and guarantees
		  associated with and embedded within GNU Licenses {\it (cf: FSF)}
  \end{itemize}
  {\it Is it possible to ethically do business and respect the
   Four Freedoms? That's where it gets interesting, as there are
   even cases where the Four Freedoms are unethical.  Note: google's
   former motto "don't be evil" is clearly (unintentionally) unethical}

\frame{\frametitle{Hardware / Development Complexity Comparison}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item {\bf Server}: relatively easy. PCIe, RapidIO, SATA, (1/10) GbE,
		 DDR3/4 or HyperRAM. No multiplexing: all interfaces dedicated
		 and high-speed differential pairs
		 \vspace{8pt}
   \item {\bf Desktop}: really just a variant of Server.
	     Graphics is a PCIe Card (except if integrated).  Peripherals
	     often done in dedicated external ICs ("Southbridge")
	     \vspace{8pt}
   \item {\bf Embedded}: also pretty easy.  Really needs a pinmux.  Low clock
         rate, low power mode.  Example: Freedom U310.
         \vspace{8pt}
   \item {\bf Mobile}: HARD. Performance/Watt matters $=>$ variable core
		 voltage domains {\it per core}.  Number of pins matters.  Cost
		 matters.  Pinmux absolutely critical.
