\frame{\frametitle{Why, How, What?}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Why? Because these days it's just not necessary to
         make [un]ethical compromises in order to make a profitable,
         desirable mass-volume product\\
         {\it (There's enough companies doing that: where it's got us??)}
   \item How? By leveraging the long-establised strategic cost and
         maintenance benefits of libre-licensed software (and
         HDL) and
         {\it making sure that the people who provide it are
         financially rewarded}.  Also by empowering diverse team
         collaboration
   \item What? A 2.5ghz RISC-V 64-bit SoC that has
		 a 3D Embedded GPU, 1080p Video decode, and interfaces
		 to make it attractive for use in tablets, netbooks, industrial
		 embedded and more.  22nm or less, under 400 pins, under USD \$4.\\
  {\it All sounds obvious... but is it practical and achievable?}
  \end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Definitions}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item {\bf Business}: the provision of a service and being
		 commensurately financially rewarded for doing so
   \item {\bf Spongeing}: the provision of a service and being
		  taken advantage of for doing so {\it (cf: Professor Yunus)}
	\item {\bf An ethical act}: an act that increases truth,
		  love, awareness or creativity for one or more people
		  (including yourself), {\it without} reducing those
		  same four qualities {\it for anyone}
	\item {\bf The Four Freedoms}: the rights and guarantees
		  associated with and embedded within GNU Licenses {\it (cf: FSF)}
  \end{itemize}
  {\it Is it possible to ethically do business and respect the
   Four Freedoms? That's where it gets interesting, as there are
   even cases where the Four Freedoms are unethical.  Note: google's
   former motto "don't be evil" is clearly (unintentionally) unethical}

\frame{\frametitle{What's the problem?}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item {\bf iMX6}: Libre bootable, Vivante 3D GPU (libre etnaviv)
            but proprietary VPU (and a power-hungry Cortex A9)
	\item {\bf Allwinner SoCs}: mostly Libre bootable,
	      VPU reverse engineered; GPU: MALI or PowerVR (i.e. proprietary)
	\item {\bf Rockchip SoCs}: good but using MALI or PowerVR.
	\item {\bf TI OMAP}: good but using PowerVR.  and expensive.
	\item {\bf Samsung}: good but using MALI.
	\item {\bf Ingenic jz4775}: GREAT! performance
		  sucks (1ghz MIPS32).
	\item {\bf Broadcom SoCs}: Cartelled. and boots from the GPU
  \end{itemize}
  {\it Basically there does not exist one single commercial SoC that
   provides full source code for all functions (CPU, GPU, VPU)
   with modern performance. Which is kinda bizarre if you think about it}
}


\frame{\frametitle{So what's needed? What would a good (Libre) SoC have?}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Cover a lot of different scenarios (embedded, tablets, industrial,
         netbooks, crypto-currency mining).
	\item Decent performance with high efficiency.  RISC-V: 40 \%
		  more efficient than ARM / Intel.  Shakti a good
	      candidate: 2.5ghz and 120mW per core @ 22nm.
	\item 1080p video: y'all gotta watch cute kittens on youtube, right?
	\item 3D GPU: y'all gotta play Angri Burds, right? (or Minecraft)
	\item No spying back-door co-processors (to steal crypto-wallets)
	\item No Spectres, no Meltdowns.
  \end{itemize}
  {\it Basically quite boring and mundane.  No Monster Performance,
   no AI stuff, no special sauce. Just a plain-old SoC,
   40\% more power efficient than ARM/Intel,
   and not spying on end-users, that's all}
}


\frame{\frametitle{How on earth does an ethical Libre SoC make money???}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Simple answer: Mask Rights.
   \item Without Mask Rights: by having a desirable
         product, and packaging it for a customer (i.e. by being a middle-man
         a service is still being provided for which payment etc. etc.)
   \item Without a desirable product or customer(s): err... you don't.\\
	     (cf: definition of Business)
   \item By not having high NREs (leveraging back-to-back deals,
	     and helping others fulfil their needs and goals)
  \end{itemize}
  {\it Detachment from the goal also helps. If someone else makes this
   product then GREAT! I can go do something else}

}

\frame{\frametitle{Things wot are "off-limits"}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Customer entrapment (through proprietary software).\\
         Strong business case for not entrapping customers:\\
	     https://tinyurl.com/most-productive-meeting-ever
   \item Funding, endorsing, supporting or empowering unethical
         Companies, Organisations, Cartels and Individuals.\\
	     (cf: definition of an ethical act).
	\item Being totally inflexible / unrealistic.  Goals have
	     to be met: it's no good being an idiot about that. e.g. if
	     a Libre 3D GPU really can't be made, use Vivante GC800
	     (with etnaviv).
  \end{itemize}
  {\it Still no real show-stoppers to making money (or product):
    it's just slightly harder, that's all.  Ultimately it's about
    confidence. }

  {\bf Separate Power Domains for GPIO banks, Variable voltages
    required, low-power sleep states etc.  Quite involved}

\frame{\frametitle{Hardware / Development Complexity Comparison}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item {\bf Server}: relatively easy. PCIe, RapidIO, XAUI, SATA, GbE, 10GE,
		 DDR3/4 (or HMC) etc. etc. No multiplexing: all interfaces dedicated
		 and high-speed differential pairs.
   \item {\bf Desktop}: really just a variant of Server.
	     Graphics is a PCIe Card (except if integrated).  Peripherals
	     often done in dedicated external ICs ("Southbridge" concept)
   \item {\bf Embedded}: also pretty easy.  Really needs a pinmux.  Low clock
         rate, low power mode.  e.g. SiFive Freedom U310.
   \item {\bf Mobile}: HARD. Performance/Watt matters $=>$ variable core
		 voltage domains {\it per core}.  Number of pins matters (affects
		 yield and package cost).  Cost
		 matters.  Pinmux critical.
  \end{itemize}
  {\it Bottom line: Mobile-class processors are challenging!}

\frame{\frametitle{Proprietary vs Libre-licensed Interface HDL}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item DDR3/4: challenging! \$1m for single-use, single instance\\
         Symbiotic EDA: \$600k for PHY, CERN developed a Controller\\
         http://libre-riscv.org/shakti/m\_class/DDR/
   \item HyperRAM (JEDEC xSPI): lower risk than DDR3/4\\
	   http://libre-riscv.org/shakti/m\_class/HyperRAM/
   \item RGMII: several available (saves \$50k)\\
	   http://libre-riscv.org/shakti/m\_class/RGMII/
   \item UART, SPI, I2C, PWM, SD/MMC: all libre (except eMMC).
   \item Shakti Group has FlexBus, QuadSPI, SRAM, many more.
   \item RGB/TTL: R. Herveille (SSD2828, SN75LVDS83b, TFP410a)
  \end{itemize}
  {\it Basically there's no compelling reason to spend vast sums
   on proprietary HDL.  Sorry Cadence / Mentor / Synopsis / whoever}
