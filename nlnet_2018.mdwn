Please be short and to the point in your answers; focus primarily on
the what and how, not so much on the why. Add longer descriptions as
attachments (see below). If English isn't your first language, don't
worry - our reviewers don't care about spelling errors, only about
great ideas. We apologise for the inconvenience of having to submit in
English. On the up side, you can be as technical as you need to be (but
you don't have to). Do stay concrete. Use plain text in your reply only,
if you need any HTML to make your point please include this as attachment.
