This page is a non-authoritative resource for information and documentation
about interrupt handling on RISC-V.  An interim page for the discussion
of interrupt handling is here: [[interrupt_handling]].

# Open PLIC Implementations

* <https://github.com/RoaLogic/plic> - written in verilog, has an
    AHB3-Lite / AMBA interface.  Documentation is here:
    <https://github.com/RoaLogic/plic/blob/master/DATASHEET.md>
* Shakti Peripherals, there is a tested (taped-out) version here
  in src/peripherals/plic <https://bitbucket.org/casl/c-class/src/>
  and another version with up to 1024 IRQ lines and a 2-cycle
  response time here <http://git.libre-riscv.org/?p=shakti-peripherals.git;a=tree;f=src/peripherals/plic>
