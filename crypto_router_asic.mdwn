  Interrupt Controller

# Example packet transfer:

* Packet comes in on RGMII port 1.  Each PHY has its own dual-ported SRAM
* Packet is **directly** stored in internal (dual-ported SRAM) by
  the RGMII PHY itself
* Interrupt notification is sent to the processor (XICS)
* Processor inspects packet over Wishbone interface directly
  connected to 2nd SRAM port.
* Processor computes, based on decoding the ETH Frame, where the
  packet must be sent to (which other RGM-II port: e.g. Port 2)
* Processor initiates Memory-to-Memory DMA transfer
* DMA Memory-to-Memory transfer, using Wishbone Bus, copies the ETH Frame
  from one on-board SRAM to the target on-board SRAM associated with Port 2.
* DMA Engine generates interrupt (XICS) to the CPU to say it is completed
* Processor notifies target RGM-II PHY to activate "send" of frame out
  through target RGM-II port 2.
