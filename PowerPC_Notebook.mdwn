# POWERPC Notebook Project

Our dream is to release an Open Source Hardware motherboard for a notebook
able to run GNU/Linux for the PowerPC architecture, a motherboard designed
by a community of enthusiasts of alternative technologies for the benefit
of the entire community.

To achieve this goal we conceived a completely new motherboard that has
at its core a relatively modern PowerPC 64bit CPU - the NXP T2080 Book3e
e6500 - that would fit into the chassis of the Slimbook Eclipse notebook
with a 15,6 inch display.

Thanks to hundreds of donors that actively support our
[Donation Campaign](https://www.powerpc-notebook.org/campaigns/donation-campaign-for-pcb-design-of-the-powerpc-notebook-motherboard/)
we were able to subcontract and collaborate with the hardware design firm
ACube System, an Italian company that has a long tradition in producing
desktop PowerPC motherboards.

Being a
[not-for-profit association](https://www.powerprogress.org/en/),
we rely on the hard work of many
volunteers that help us on various aspects. Fixing or fine tuning
Debian packages for the PowerPC 64 bit architecture, supporting the
communication on multiple social medias, helping with translations and
revising the electronic design are just some of the activities we are
currently carrying out to revive the PowerPC platform.
