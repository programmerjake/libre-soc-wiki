\frame{\frametitle{Why another SoC?}

\vspace{15pt}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Intel Management Engine, QA issues, Spectre\vspace{15pt}
   \item Endless proprietary drivers \\
   		 (affects product development cost)\vspace{15pt}
   \item Opportunity to drastically simplify driver development\\
	     and engage in "long-tail" markets\vspace{15pt}
   \item Because for 30 years I Always Wanted To Design A CPU\vspace{10pt}
  \end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Why OpenPOWER? (but first: Evaluation Criteria)}

\vspace{15pt}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Good ecosystem essential\\
   		 linux kernel, u-boot, compilers, OSes,\\
   		 Reference Implementation(s)\vspace{12pt}
   \item Supportive Foundation and Members\\
   		 need to be able to submit ISA augmentations\\
   		 (for proper peer review)\vspace{12pt}
   \item No NDAs, full transparency must be acceptable\\
	     due to being funded under NLnet's PET Programme\vspace{12pt}
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Why OpenPOWER?}


 \begin{itemize}
   \item RISC-V: closed secretive mailing lists, closed secretive\\
   		 ISA Working Groups, no acceptance of transparency\\
   		 requirements, not well-established enough
   \item MIPS Open Initiative website was offline
   \item ARM and x86 are proprietary (x86 too complex)
   \item OpenRISC 1200 not enough adoption
   \item Nyuzi GPU too specialist (not a general-purpose ISA)
   \item MIAOW GPU is not a GPU (it's an AMD Vector Engine)
   \item "rolling your own" out of the question (20+ man-years)
   \item OpenPOWER: established for decades, excellent Foundation,\\
   	     Microwatt as Reference, approachable and friendly.
  \end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Summary}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Actually about parallelism, not Vectors (or SIMD) per se\\
         and NOT about adding new ALU/logic/functionality.
