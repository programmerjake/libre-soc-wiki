\frame{\frametitle{Why another SoC?}

\vspace{15pt}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Intel Management Engine, QA issues, Spectre\vspace{15pt}
   \item Endless proprietary drivers \\
   		 (affects product development cost)\vspace{15pt}
   \item Opportunity to drastically simplify driver development\\
	     and engage in "long-tail" markets\vspace{15pt}
   \item Because for 30 years I Always Wanted To Design A CPU\vspace{10pt}
  \end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Why OpenPOWER? (but first: Evaluation Criteria)}

\vspace{15pt}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Good ecosystem essential\\
   		 linux kernel, u-boot, compilers, OSes,\\
   		 Reference Implementation(s)\vspace{12pt}
   \item Supportive Foundation and Members\\
   		 need to be able to submit ISA augmentations\\
   		 (for proper peer review)\vspace{12pt}
   \item No NDAs, full transparency must be acceptable\\
	     due to being funded under NLnet's PET Programme\vspace{12pt}
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Why OpenPOWER?}


 \begin{itemize}
   \item RISC-V: closed secretive mailing lists, closed secretive\\
   		 ISA Working Groups, no acceptance of transparency\\
   		 requirements, not well-established enough
   \item MIPS Open Initiative website was offline
   \item ARM and x86 are proprietary (x86 too complex)
   \item OpenRISC 1200 not enough adoption
   \item Nyuzi GPU too specialist (not a general-purpose ISA)
   \item MIAOW GPU is not a GPU (it's an AMD Vector Engine)
   \item "rolling your own" out of the question (20+ man-years)
   \item OpenPOWER: established for decades, excellent Foundation,\\
   	     Microwatt as Reference, approachable and friendly.
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{What goes into a typical SoC?}
\vspace{9pt}
 \begin{itemize}
   \item 15 to 20mm BGA package: 2.5 to 5 watt power consumption\\
   		heat sink normally not required (simplifies overall design)
   		\vspace{10pt}
   \item Fully-integrated peripherals (not Northbridge/Southbridge)\\
         USB, HDMI, RGB/TTL, SD/MMC, I2C, UART, SPI, GPIO etc. etc. 
         \vspace{10pt}
   \item Built-in GPU (shared memory bus, 3rd party licensed) \vspace{10pt}
   \item Build-in VPU (likewise)\vspace{10pt}
   \item Target price between \$2.50 and \$30 depending on market\\
         Radically different from IBM POWER9 Core (200 Watt)
         \vspace{10pt}
  \end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Where to start? (roadmap)}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item First thing: get a basic core working on an FPGA\\
         (use Microwatt as a reference)
   \item Next: create a low-cost test ASIC (180nm).\\
   		 (first OpenPOWER ASIC since IBM's POWER9, 10 years ago)
   \item (in parallel): Develop Vector ISA with 3D and Video\\
   		 extensions, under watchful eye of OpenPOWER Foundation
   \item Implement Vector ISA in simulator, then HDL, then FPGA\\
         and finally (only when ratified by OPF) into silicon
   \item Sell chips, make \$\$\$.
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{What's different about Libre-SOC?}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Hybrid - integrated.  The CPU \textit{is} the GPU.\\
         The GPU \textit{is} the CPU.  The VPU \textit{is} the CPU.\\
         \textit{There is No Separate VPU/GPU Pipeline}
   		  \vspace{9pt}
   \item written in nmigen (a python-based HDL).  Not VHDL\\
   		  not Verilog (definitely not Chisel3/Scala)\\
   		  This is an extremely important strategic decision.
   		  \vspace{9pt}
   \item Simple-V Vector Extension.  See "SIMD Considered harmful".\\
   		SV effectively a "hardware for-loop" on standard scalar ISA\\
   		(conceptually similar to Zero-Overhead Loops in DSPs)
   		  \vspace{9pt}
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Hybrid Architecture: Augmented 6600}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item CDC 6600 is a design from 1965.  The \textit{augmentations} are not.\\
   		 Help from Mitch Alsup includes "precise exceptions", \\
   		 multi-issue and more. Academic literature on 6600 utterly misleading.
   		6600 Scoreboards completely underestimated. 
   \item Front-end Vector ISA, back-end "Predicated (masked) SIMD"\\
         nmigen (python OO) strategically critical to achieving this.
   \item Out-of-order combined with Simple-V allows scalar operations\\
         at the developer end to be turned into SIMD at the back-end\\
         \textit{without the developer needing to do SIMD}
   \item IEEE754 sin / cos / atan2, Texturisation opcodes, YUV2RGB\\
   		 all automatically vectorised.
  \end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Summary}

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Actually about parallelism, not Vectors (or SIMD) per se\\
         and NOT about adding new ALU/logic/functionality.
  \end{itemize}
