# LD.X and LD.Swizzle

See <http://bugs.libre-riscv.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139>

SV is based on vectorisation of scalar opcodes. LD and ST from scalar RISCV can be extended by either rd or rs1 being vectorised, however a third "immediate element strided" multiples do not fit.

In addition, Vulkan requires swizzled LD/ST covering:

* constant 0, 1
* min/max int/uint
* 1.0 and
* x, y, z, or w.
