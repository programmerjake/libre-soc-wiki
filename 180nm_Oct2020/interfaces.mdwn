# Interfaces for the 180nm Oct2020 ASIC

Bugreport and discussion at <https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=304>

These are bare minimum viability:
These should be easily doable with LiteX.

* [[shakti/m_class/UART]]
* [[shakti/m_class/I2C]]
* [[shakti/m_class/GPIO]]
* [[shakti/m_class/SPI]]
* [[shakti/m_class/QSPI]]
* [[shakti/m_class/LPC]]
* [[shakti/m_class/EINT]]
* [[shakti/m_class/JTAG]]

Under consideration:

* [[shakti/m_class/sdram]] see <http://lists.libre-riscv.org/pipermail/libre-riscv-dev/2020-May/006374.html>

# Secondary priorities

* a pinmux
* USB - again doable with LiteX. I'm talking to Enjoy Digital about what USB PHYs LiteX supports. - Yehowshua
* SERDES for Ethernet - using LiteX and [Marvell PHY](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Marvell/88E1512-A0-NNP2I000?qs=vdi0iO8H4N0XzuXqBRxTqg%3D%3D)
* Noting that a SERDES to RGMII PHY is $20(kinda expensive for total cost of an SBC), we can instead do Eth over USB like the original RPI. This moves the complexity to software - could make doing eth things during boot loader a little more complex.
