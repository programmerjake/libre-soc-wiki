# Interfaces for the 180nm Oct2020 ASIC

http://lists.libre-riscv.org/pipermail/libre-riscv-dev/2020-May/006355.html

Bugreport and discussion at <https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=304>

These are bare minimum viability:

* [[shakti/m_class/UART]]
* [[shakti/m_class/I2C]]
* [[shakti/m_class/GPIO]]
* [[shakti/m_class/SPI]]
* [[shakti/m_class/QSPI]]
* [[shakti/m_class/LPC]]
* [[shakti/m_class/EINT]]
* [[shakti/m_class/JTAG]]

Under consideration:

* [[shakti/m_class/sdram]] see <http://lists.libre-riscv.org/pipermail/libre-riscv-dev/2020-May/006374.html>

# Secondary priorities

* a PLL (this is quite a lot however it turns the ASIC from a 24mhz
design into a 300mhz design)
* a TLB and MMU (in combination with a PLL if it is GNU/Linux OS
capable we have an actual viable *saleable product*, immediately)
* dual L1 Caches with the 2x 128-bit-wide L0CacheBuffer to merge 8x LD/STs
* multiple Common Data Buses to / from the RegFile along with a 4x
"Striped" HI/LO-32-ODD/EVEN access pattern.
* multi-issue
* PartitionedSignal-based integer pipelines
* an FP regfile and associated FP pipelines
* SV compliance
* 128x INT/FP registers
* GPU-style opcodes - Jacob you mentioned Texturisation opcodes as
being more important than e.g. SIN/COS.
* additional interfaces such as RGB/TTL, SDRAM, HyperRAM, RGMII,
SD/MMC, USB-ULPI
* a pinmux
