 - give mass volume appliance manufacturers an alternative to expensive un-auditable chips.
 - maximize the degree of trust a customer can place in their processor. 

## The Means:

provide the customer the **freedom to study, modify, and redistribute** the full SoC source from HDL and boot loader to down to the VLSI.

## The Market:

 - chromebooks
 - smartphones
 - tablets
 - industrial boards
 - single-board computers (like the Raspberry Pi)
 - whatever you want

## The Machine:

a (quad core, 800mhz, dual issue, 4-wide FP32, CPU, GPU, VPU, [and later an ML inference core] ) SOC.
