# IPC Extension

see Tony Brewer's (Micron) slides.

see barrelfish paper

idea: copy POSIX send/recv/select semantics

dependency(?): scratch/CAM memory extension

* MSTORE: message send; send message to a target hart) and store it in
  its message-buffer. Traps when target buffer is full.
* MLOAD: message load; load message from local message buffer. Traps
  when buffer is empty.
* MFLUSH(?): flush local buffer
* MSELECT: check if send (or receive) can succeed (or block)

------

I don't want to propose or advocate a full solution at this point, but
a simple one might use a small CAM-based message system for fast
storage (write) and retrieval (read) using an agreed key. If this was
to fit into a two-operand instruction, both the key and destination
must be encoded into one source register, with the data-to-send
encoded into the other source register, and a result (sent or dropped)
returned into rd.

rs1 = key-id = prepare-to-send(dest-processID) // a system call to
allocate a communications channel + src + dest encoded into key-id
rs2 = data
rd = return code

MSEND  rd, rs1, rs2 // to send
MRECVB rd, rs1, x0  // nonblocking receive, returns 0 if no data present
MRECVB rd, rs1, x0  // blocking receive

behaviour:
MSEND is nonblocking, [rd]=1 on successful acceptance network (network
delivery guaranteed)
MRECV is nonblocking, [rd]=0 on no data to receive, [rd]=message
otherwise (cannot send 0 as message)
MRECVB is blocking, waits until data arrives (can send 0 as a message)I don't want to propose or advocate a full solution at this point, but

MSEND can be like ST, but I chose to have a return value to indicate
whether the send was accepted (i.e., copied into xmit buffer). this
enables sharing of resources at the sender (future senders will be
denied until the xmit buffer has space).

MRECV has two versions, blocking and non-blocking. the non-blocking
version allows the hart to do a bit more work before checking whether
data has arrived. the blocking version waits until data is received.

to improve upon the messaging system I described, there would need to
be backing storage in main memory for the CAM data. perhaps the CAM
needs to operate with an eviction policy based upon oldest-first. main
memory would then store anything that is evicted. that way any values
in the CAM that aren't used right away will migrate into main memory;
it is acceptable to move them there because this is already a high

----

Maybe the *newest* message should spill to memory instead?  This keeps
messages in FIFO order and could be easier to implement -- MSEND traps,
supervisor transfers the message to memory and sets a bit in the target's
task state indicating "RX queue overflow".  When the target task finally
does drain its RX queue, and that bit is set, MRECV traps to permit the
supervisor to reload the hardware queue from the memory overflow area.

This avoids needing background DMA for the message buffers in hardware
and allows supervisors to fully implement the overflow queues, rather
than forcing a hardware-imposed structure.
