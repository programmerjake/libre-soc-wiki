# Vector Operations Extension to SV

This extension is dependent on SV SUBVL being implemented. When SUBVL is set to define the length of a subvector the operations in this extension interpret the elements as a single vector.

Normally in SV all operations are scalar and independent.  In this extension, the subvector itself is the unit. Examples include cross product and may in future involve complex numbers.

## Vector cross product

Result is the cross product of x and y, i.e., the resulting components are, in order:

    x[1] * y[2] - y[1] * x[2]
    x[2] * y[0] - y[2] * x[0]
    x[0] * y[1] - y[0] * x[1]

All the operands must be vectors of 3 components of a floating-point type.

## Vector dot product

## Vector length

The scalar length of a vector

    sqrt(x[0]^2 + x[1]^2 + ...).

## Vector distance

The scalar distance between two vectors. Subtracts one vector from the other and returns length

## Vector LERP

## Vector SLERP
