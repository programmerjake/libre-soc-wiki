# Vector Operations Extension to SV

This extension is dependent on SV SUBVL bring implemented. When SUBVL is set to define the length of a subvector the operations in this extension interpret the elements as a single vector.

Normally in SV all operations are scalar and independent.  In this extension, the subvector itself is the unit. Examples include cross product and may in future involve complex numbers.

## Vector cross product

## Vector dot product

## Vector length

## Vector LERP

## Vector SLERP
