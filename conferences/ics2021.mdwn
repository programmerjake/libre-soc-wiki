# Luke Leighton bio

Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton specialises in Libre Ethical Technology.
He has been using and programming computers continuously for 44 years,
has a BEng (Hons), ACGI, in Theory of Computing from Imperial College,
and recently put that education to good use in the form of the Libre-SOC
Project: an entirely Libre-Licensed 3D Hybrid CPU-VPU-GPU based on
OpenPOWER. He writes poetry and has been developing a HEP Physics theory
for the past 36 years in his spare time.

# SVP64 Abstract

The OpenPOWER ISA has a strong multi-decades pedigree in Supercomputing:
Matrix Multiply, 128-bit SIMD, BCD, Decimal Floating-point have been part
of the ISA for decades, supporting Business and Scientific Computing.
What the OpenPOWER ISA does not have is Vector processing, first
successfully found in the Cray-1 Supercomputer, from 1976.

SVP64 is an initiative being developed by the Libre-SOC team and
funded by NLnet, that brings Cray-style Variable-length Vectorisation
to the OpenPOWER ISA in a seamless and non-disruptive fashion.  The team
is keeping the OpenPOWER Foundation appraised of progress, and plans to 
submit SVP64 as an RFC to the newly-formed OpenPOWER ISA Working Group.

SVP64 is based on the concept of embedding scalar operations into
a Vectorisation Context: effectively a simple Sub-Program-Counter for-loop.
However that Vectorisation Context effectively extends each of the 200+
primary scalar operations in the OpenPOWER ISA by a factor of 4,000,
to produce a staggering and unprecedented 800,000 unique Vector opcodes.

Although SVP64 borrows from innovations in Computer Science over the
past 50 years, including the original Cray Vectors, VLIW, Zero-overhead
Loops from DSPs and Intel MMX, the end result is something entirely new.
This talk will go through the development process of SVP64 and explain
some of the innovative Vectorisation concepts that have never been seen 
before in any commercial or academic Vector ISA, including
Twin-Predication and "Post-result" predication, and how these will
benefit Supercomputing performance and decrease power consumption,
by reducing I-Cache usage.
