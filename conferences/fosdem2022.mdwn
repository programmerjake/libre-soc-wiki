Why does it fit FOSDEM

There has been a lot of changes happening in the last few years regarding chiptechnology. From RISC-V to attempts to create libre/free processes to make your own chips. Various countries have been catching up and helping and building up their semiconducter industries, some even pushing libre/free toolchains.

Meanwhile others push the boundaries to liberate former closed source toolchains for FPGAs. While an often neglected topic, a lot of work happens by various fantastic players all around the world. We hope to bring some attention to this areas which we basicly all too often take as a given when using computers.
