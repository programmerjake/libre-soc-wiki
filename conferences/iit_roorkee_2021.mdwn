# IIT Rourkee 2021

## Abstract

The Libre-SOC Project aims to create an entirely Libre-Licensed,
transparently-developed fully auditable Hybrid 3D CPU-GPU-VPU,
using the Supercomputer-class OpenPOWER ISA as the foundation.

Our first test ASIC is a 180nm "Fixed-Point" Power ISA v3.0B
processor, 5.1mm x 5.9mm, as a proof-of-concept for the team,
whose primary expertise is in Software Engineering.  Software
Engineering training brings a radically different approach to
Hardware development: extensive unit tests, source code revision
control, automated development tools are normal.  Libre Project
Management brings even more: bugtrackers, mailing lists, auditable
IRC logs and a wiki are standard fare for Libre Projects that are
simply not normal Industry-Standard practice.

This talk therefore goes through the workflow, from the original
HDL through to the GDS-II layout, showing how we were able to keep
track of the development that led to the IMEC 180nm tape-out in
July 2021.
