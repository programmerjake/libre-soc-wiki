# Libre-SOC

by Luke Leighton.  bio:

Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton specialises in Libre Ethical Technology.
He has been using, programming and reverse-engineering computing
devices continuously for 44 years, has a BEng (Hons), ACGI, in Theory
of Computing from Imperial College, and recently put that education to
good use in the form of the Libre-SOC Project: an entirely
Libre-Licensed 3D Hybrid CPU-VPU-GPU based on OpenPOWER. He writes
poetry and has been developing a HEP Physics theory for the past 36
years in his spare time.

## Abstract: Overview of the Libre-SOC Project

The Libre-SOC Project aims to provide a mass-volume processor with
3D and Video capability built-in to the ISA, for use in end-user products
such as smartphones netbooks chromebooks tablets and Industrial SBC/IoT.
It is a massive project, starting small and being developed "smart".

Why it is being created - at all - can be easily guaged by examining
the littering of systematic failures by multiple large Corporations:
Intel Management Engine, Qualcomm leaving 40% of the world's smartphones
vulnerable to hijacking, Apple drive-by WIFI zero-exploits, Supermicro
de-listed from NASDAQ, Huawei, Smartphones shipping by default with
Trojans, and many others.

Efforts to fix this (Fairphone) simply do not go far back enough down
the chain.  Just as Google sees the only solution to Rowhammer to be
to create a Libre/Open LPDDR4 Memory PHY and Controller (because the
existing RTL providers cannot be trusted to solve it properly), we
see the only solution to be to take full responsibility for creating a
suitable full-on Embedded high-end multi-core System-on-a-Chip, done
entirely Libre.

This talk will therefore provide a high-level overview into some of the
technical decisions behind the "why", in order to achieve such a
ridicuously-ambitious goal in a "smarter" (rather than "work harder")
innovative way.

    Those who only know what they do, work harder. Those who also
    know WHY they do what they do, work smarter.
