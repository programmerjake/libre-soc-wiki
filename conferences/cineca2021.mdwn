# Title:  An introduction to Libre-SOC and Cray-style Vectors for OpenPOWER

The current HPC / Supercomputer market has few top contenders:China ICT Loongson 3, Intel / AMD x86 and IBM POWER9/10.None of these have the features of one of the most iconicSupercomputer ISA: Cray-style Vectors, known historicallyfor compact program size and massive number-crunchingcapability.
Libre-SOC is working under the close watchful eye of the OpenPOWERFoundation to develop Draft Extensions to the Power ISA, extendingthe already-proven Supercomputing-grade Power ISA with Cray-styleVectors.  This talk will give a brief overview of the progress androadmap.
