# Title:  An introduction to Libre-SOC and Cray-style Vectors for OpenPOWER

The current HPC / Supercomputer market has few top contenders:
China ICT Loongson 3, Intel / AMD x86 and IBM POWER9/10.
None of these have the features of one of the most iconic
Supercomputer ISA: Cray-style Vectors, known historically
for compact program size and massive number-crunching
capability.

Libre-SOC is working under the close watchful eye of the OpenPOWER
Foundation to develop Draft Extensions to the Power ISA, extending
the already-proven Supercomputing-grade Power ISA with Cray-style
Vectors.  This talk will give a brief overview of the progress and
roadmap.

# Bio

Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton specialises in Libre Ethical Technology.
He has been using, programming and reverse-engineering computing
devices continuously for 44 years, has a BEng (Hons), ACGI, in
Theory of Computing from Imperial College, and recently put that
education to good use in the form of the Libre-SOC
Project: an entirely Libre-Licensed 3D Hybrid CPU-VPU-GPU based on
OpenPOWER. He writes poetry and has been developing a HEP Physics theory
for the past 36 years in his spare time.
