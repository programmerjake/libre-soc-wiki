# Roadmap

Under development

* check with the RISC-V LLVM backend maintainer [email](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2018-September/126396.html) and
  * if they aren't going to complete the RV64GC codegen support soon,
  * start working on adding support for RV64GC codegen based on
    [lowRISC/riscv-llvm](https://github.com/lowRISC/riscv-llvm) using
    [andestech/riscv-llvm](https://github.com/andestech/riscv-llvm/tree/riscv-release_50/lib/Target/RISCV)
    for reference.
* Add support for RV64GC on Linux to Rust in order to write the user-space
  graphics driver in Rust, I can start by using andestech/riscv-llvm if
  not implementing RV64GC for LLVM
* **(started 2018sep24)** Implement Simple-V support in Spike
* Add Linux support for Simple-V & Asymmetric Multi Processing
* Implement Simple-V support in LLVM and wire up Rust's SIMD to support it
* **(started 2018sep24)** Begin Vulkan3D Rust driver (Kazan3D),
  starting on x86 first, to have a stable codebase to work from.
* Start working on the HW design and figure out the remainder of the plan
