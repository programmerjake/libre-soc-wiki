do you mean "mission statement"?

we are creating a full libre architected  hybrid CPU/VPU/GPU for manufacturers who need security through full transparency of ssoftware and hardware, with greatly reduced RTL licensing costs, unlike other chips in this field which have unauditable architectures and proprietary drivers.

* Because both 3D and VPU hardware and software are fully transparent, application devrlopment time and debugging complexity is massively reduced.
* the chip design is being created in commonly-available programming languages, making it easier to understand.
* the development follows libre project management principles meaning that there  is a full audit trail for maintenance and audit purposes.
* the formal proofs make testing and trust much easier.
* the full transparency leverages experts' willingness to openly assist and help our business succeed, greatly reducing NREs and reducing risk.
