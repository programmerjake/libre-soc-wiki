# build instructions, by vivek

Sure I will add details about how to build the code, I use basically meson
and ninja commands,
My build directory located in mesa source here is my meson command to
configure (I know this does more work than require please add more options
if you find useful):

    meson -Dbuildtype=debug -Dprefix=/home/vivek/install -Dvulkan-drivers=libresoc ..

and then

    ninja
    ninja install.

I also have script to set few environment variables like

    export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/home/vivek/install/share/vulkan/icd.d/libresoc_icd.x86_64.json
    export VK_LOADER_DEBUG=warn
    export LIBRESOC_TRACE=1

To test the code I am sing simple tests built by
    https://github.com/GameTechDev/IntroductionToVulkan

I am also using debug build for vulkan loader if any one interested in that
please look at
    https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader/blob/master/BUILD.md
