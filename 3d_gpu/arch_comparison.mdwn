* (1) too numerous reasons to count, for well over 4 years.
* (2) efforts to be "open" have stalled, website non-functional
* (3) OpenPower Foundation making a huge effort, really appreciated
* (4) repeated in-good-faith requests for participation and inclusion in
  extending RISC-V have met with stone-cold silence for over 18 months,
  in direct violation of Trademark Law's clear-cut responsibilities.
* (5) provisionally and in principle: yes.  however as of 2019jan21 this is
  yet to be tested and an agreement reached.
* (6) no mentions of virtualization found in spec
* (7) dozens to hundreds of people, several companies
