# 180nm Test ASIC

This is a single-core, non-SMP, no analog PLLs, no clock-gating, test ASIC,
expected to run at one-to-one from an external 24 mhz to 100 mhz clock.

The requirements are therefore **radically different** from the next
roadmap ASIC.

Basic diagram:

[[!img 180nm_single_core_testasic_memlayout.jpg size="500x"]]

* Eight LD/ST Function Units with 2 ports each (one for aligned,
  one for misaligned), each connecting to one of a pair of L0
  Cache/Buffers.  Addr[4] determines which L0 Cache/Buffer to
  connect to.

* Twin L0 Cache/Buffers with only 16 128-bit-wide entries and
  a single-clock, single-path outgoing read **or** write protocol,
  with 16 (individual, non-multiplexed) incoming 128-bit entries.

* Each L0 Cache/Buffer connects by a single 128-bit data path
  to a standard non-SMP-aware L1 cache.  The data in and out
  is again read **or** write, 128-bit-wide.

* A pair of Wishbone "funnels" take the 128-bit requests, which include
  byte-level access lines, and *if needed* create a pair of 64-bit
  Wishbone-compliant requests.  "If needed", because if the lower
  half (or upper half) byte-level access lines are not set, then
  that indicates a 64-bit request, and thus only one request is needed.
  Only when byte-access lines in both upper and lower halves are set
  will two requests be needed

* Standard Wishbone 64-bit Bus.  This is where
  [Enjoy-Digital Litex](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex)
  code takes over, and connect to peripherals and testing infrastructure.

* Memory is the silicon-proven OpenCores [SDRAM|sdram] interface,
  and it is Wishbone compliant.

## Memory Interface Required by LDSTComputationalUnit

See <https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216#c26>.  Other signals
(type of LD/ST: atomic or I/O, type of exception) left out for brevity

Common to LD/ST:

* out: busy
* in: is_ld
* in: address
* in: len (1/2/4/8)
* in: go_addr
* in: go_die
* out: addr_ok (no exception will occur)
* out: addr_exc (exception type)

LD:

* in: is_ld
* out: ld_data
* out: ld_data_ok (to be raised for 1 cycle)

ST:

* in: is_st
* in: st_data
* in: go_st (raised for 1 cycle, must complete)

## Alternative Design Idea

[[alternative-design-idea]]

# 28-45nm Quad-Core SoC

This is full SMP, requires analog PLLs, clock gating, full SMP
L1 and L2 cache coherency and atomic coherency.
