# Dynamic Partitioned Multiply

This is complicated!  It is necessary to compute a full NxN matrix of partial multiplication results, then perform a cascade of adds, using PartitionedAdd to "automatically" break them down into segments.  The [Wallace Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_tree) algorithm is presently deployed, here: we need to use the (more efficient) [Dadda algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadda_multiplier)
