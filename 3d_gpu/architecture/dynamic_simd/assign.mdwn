# PartitionedSignal nmigen-aware eq (assign)

* <https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709>

For copying (assigning) PartitionedSignal to PartitionedSignal
of equal size there is no issue.  However if the source has a
greater width than the target, *partition-aware* truncation
must occur.  For the opposite, sign/zero extension must occur.
Finally for a Signal or Const, duplication across all Partitions
must occur, again, following the rules of zero, sign or unsigned.

Take two PartitionedSignals (source a, dest b) of 32 bit:

    partition:      p    p    p       (3 bits)
    a        :  AAA3 AAA2 AAA1 AAA0  (32 bits)
    b        :  BBB3 BBB2 BBB1 BBB0  (32 bits)

For all partition settings this copies verbatim.
