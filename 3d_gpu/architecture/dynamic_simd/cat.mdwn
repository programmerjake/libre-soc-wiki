# PartitionedSignal nmigen-aware Cat

Concatenation of Signals is ordinarily straightforward: reduce to the bitlevel and create a sequence.  The contributors to that sequence may be of arbitrary length.

However for a PartitionedSignal unless *all* contributors are also
PartitionedSignals, the results cannot be guaranteed to match, at all
partition sizes.

Take two PartitionedSignals:

    partition:      p    p    p       (3 bits)
    a        :  AAA3 AAA2 AAA1 AAA0  (32 bits)
    b        :  BBB3 BBB2 BBB1 BBB0  (32 bits)

When the partitions are 32-bit, the output is:

    partition:           p         p         p           (3 bits)
    out      :  AAA3 AAA2 AAA1 AAA0 BBB3 BBB2 BBB1 BBB0  (64 bits)

When 2x16:
