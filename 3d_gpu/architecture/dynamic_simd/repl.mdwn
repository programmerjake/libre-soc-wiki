# PartitionedSignal nmigen-aware Repl

* <https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=458>

Partitioned Repl is very similar to [[cat]] and
[[assign]].  The output completely changes depending
on the partition mask.

Take a PartitionedSignal:

    partition:      p    p    p       (3 bits)
    a        :  AAA3 AAA2 AAA1 AAA0  (32 bits)

When the partitions are 32-bit, the output is:

    partition:           p         p         p           (3 bits)
    out      :  AAA3 AAA2 AAA1 AAA0 BBB3 BBB2 BBB1 BBB0  (64 bits)

When 2x16, the top 2 halves of A and B are Catted together,
and likewise the lower:

    partition:           p         p         p           (3 bits)
    out      :  AAA3 AAA2 BBB3 BBB2 AAA1 AAA0 BBB1 BBB0  (64 bits)

Finally when 4x8, each byte is concatenated:

    partition:           p         p         p           (3 bits)
    out      :  AAA3 BBB3 AAA2 BBB2 AAA1 BBB1 AAA0 BBB0  (64 bits)
