# SimdShape

A logical extension of the nmigen `ast.Shape` concept, `SimdShape`
provides sufficient context to both define overrides for individual lengths
on a per-mask basis as well as sufficient information to "upcast"
back to a SimdSignal, in exactly the same way that c++ virtual base
class upcasting works when RTTI (Run Time Type Information) works.
