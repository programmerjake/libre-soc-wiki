# 6600-style Scoreboards

# Modifications needed to Computation Unit and Group Picker

The scoreboard uses two big NOR gates respectively to determine when there
are no read/write hazards.  These two NOR gates are permanently active
(per Function Unit) even if the Function Unit is idle.

In the case of the Write path, these "permanently-on" signals are gated
by a Write-Release-Request signal that would otherwise leave the Priority
Picker permanently selecting one of the Function Units (the highest priority).
However the same thing has to be done for the read path, as well.

Below are the modifications required to add a read-release path that
will prevent a Function Unit from requesting a GoRead signal when it
has no need to read registers.  Note that once both the Busy and GoRead
signals combined are dropped, the ReadRelease is dropped.

Note that this is a loop: GoRead (ANDed with Busy) goes through
to the priority picker, which generates GoRead, so it is critical
(in a modern design) to use a clock-sync'd latch in this path.
