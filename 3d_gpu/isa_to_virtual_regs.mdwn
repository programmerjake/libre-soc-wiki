Explanation:

* ISA reg numbers are in rows
* Virtual (including renamed) reg numbers are in columns
* from both the bottom *and* the right are multi-issue (unary) "Set1,
  Set2" signals
* where these cross they are ANDed to set a Latch in a given cell
  - at no time will there be more than one cell set per row
  - OR per column
* there being only one per column a "reset" signal can be per column
* for regfile port "lookup" the per-column Set1/Set2 wires may be re-used
  - they may be binary or unary as preferred
  - read and write ports are all numbered
* a "request virtual-to-real regfile port redirection" signal is along
  the bottom
  - this is ANDed with the Latch
  - that is MUXed with the per-column Set1/Set2 wires
  - ANDs which accumulate in Great Big ORs fire per-row outputs

in this way any "virtual" read or write request to a register file port
may be translated to a "real" request.  the actual regfile data transfers
on respective associated broadcast buses are external and do not need
routing through this Matrix: the Matrix simply provides name translation,
nothing else.

note that if regfile port IDs are encoded in binary, an entire column
can light up like a Mythbusters Christmas tree with XOR gates unless
the EN is carefully arranged.
