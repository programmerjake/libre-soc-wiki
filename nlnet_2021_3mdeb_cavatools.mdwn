Please be short and to the point in your answers; focus primarily on
the what and how, not so much on the why. Add longer descriptions as
attachments (see below). If English isn't your first language, don't
worry - our reviewers don't care about spelling errors, only about
great ideas. We apologise for the inconvenience of having to submit in
English. On the up side, you can be as technical as you need to be (but
you don't have to). Do stay concrete. Use plain text in your reply only,
if you need any HTML to make your point please include this as attachment.

## Abstract: Can you explain the whole project and its expected outcome(s).

Cavatools is currently a high performance user-operated simulator of
the RISC-V ISA. The primary objective of the project is to extend it to
implement the scalar Power ISA and the Libre-SOC Draft SVP64
Extensions. This will allow rapid prototyping of Extensions to the
Power ISA long before they reach silicon (which is very costly).
In turn this helps Libre-SOC to deliver on its commitment to provide
user-trustable processors for use in Internet routers, desktop,
smartphone and other user-operated devices where security and transparency
is expected.

# Have you been involved with projects or organisations relevant to this project before? And if so, can you tell us a bit about your contributions?

3mdeb is currently helping Libre-SOC with the (horribly slow,
easy-to-read, easy-to-use) Libre-SOC Power ISA Simulator which is 20,000 times
slower than cavatools. 3mdeb is also helping with ISA level unit tests in
Libre-SOC's code base that will be used to cross-validate a huge range of
Power ISA simulators and actual silicon implementations.

# Requested Amount    

EUR $50,000.

# Explain what the requested budget will be used for? 

* To create a compiler which takes Libre-SOC Machine-readable
  Power ISA specification files and generate c code
* To extend cavatools to include support for the Scalar
  parts of the Power ISA
* To then add support for Libre-SOC's Draft SVP64 Extensions
* To enhance it to include gdb "remote" machine interface
  support
* To add Power ISA RADIX MMU emulation
* To extend cavatools to run a very basic linux
  initramfs in-memory with basic serial console access
* To demonstrate running first a single core linux kernel
  and later a SMP one, with busybox
* To use the exact same Specification c compiler to create
  an "illegal instruction trap" emulator, integrated
  into the linux kernel, for emulating Power ISA SIMD instructions
  (extending the existing trap-and-emulate code already present
   in ppc64 linux kernel source code)

# Does the project have other funding sources, both past and present?

Although there is NLnet funding for the Libre-SOC Simulator
(written in python) and associayed unit tests, cavatools, which is
written in c by Peter Hsu, does not have funding for the Power ISA
aditions. cavatools itself is a very new project.

# Compare your own project with existing or historical efforts.

Although there are quite a few Power ISA simulators, none of them
are up-to-date or are suited to high performance, like cavatools.
cavatools is multi-process and extremely fast, using relatively little
memory, where power-gem5, which has a different focus and has huge flexibility
and usefulness for research, uses vast amounts
of memory and is much slower. cavatools also has hardware-level cycle-accurate emulation which is extremely useful and important for analysing experimental
instructions, which is a feature that no other Power ISA Simulator has.
DolphinPC and pearpc are over 15 years old and were targetted at 32 bit
emulation of much older Power ISA processors. Libre-SOC's python-based
simulator only achieves aroubd 2,000 instructions per second on
high performance hardware whereas
cavatools achieves 200,000 instructions per second per processor
on modest hardware.
IBM's own Power ISA simulator is proprietary and, because it contains
confidential experimentation internal to IBM, may not be made public.

## What are significant technical challenges you expect to solve during the project, if any?

This is at its heart a compiler project, which can be a challenging
area. However the language being implemented is quite small and limited,
so the project is relatively straightforward.

## Describe the ecosystem of the project, and how you will engage with relevant actors and promote the outcomes?

The project will be developed entirely publicly and transparently,
using Libre-SOC Project Resources which are already set up for trustable
auditability and transparency. The mailing lists therefore are always
publicly available.

Online conferences and talks will be given as progress
is made, as well as working with Libre-SOC to send out development
reports and progress.
