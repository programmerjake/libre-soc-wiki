Dear OPF Board,

As you know the LibreSOC team have been working for over 3 years on a massive conceptual upgrade to the OpenPOWER ISA, based on Cray-Style Vectors, which will modernise it for today's 3D and VPU workloads, with an incidental side-effect of upgrading it for future supercomputing needs.  RISC-V has RVV, ARM has SVE2, x86 has AVX512, whilst OpenPOWER has an out-of-date SIMD ISA. It goes without saying that over the decades, SIMD has been demonstrated to be harmful.

Normally, such huge ISA development efforts would be instigated, organised and funded through either Academia or an extremely large Corporation, or a Consortium combining multiple such entities.  It is therefore without precedent across the Computing Industry for something of this magnitude of effort to come not only from a Libre background but from a Libre background that is funded by a Charitable Foundation with a mandate to fund "Works for the Public Good".

From reading the PowerISA v3.0C sections we have learned and taken on board that a "Sandbox" opcode exists (EXT22) which is intended for "small private extensions" to the OpenPOWER ISA.  Our Bitmanipulation Extension, needed for Audio/Video and cryptographic workloads, struggles to fit into that space, and we have not yet added Custom 3D opcodes or the IEEE754 Transcendentals (SIN, COS) 

In speaking with various people (Toshaan, Paul and Hugh) we have pieced together the way that the Op
