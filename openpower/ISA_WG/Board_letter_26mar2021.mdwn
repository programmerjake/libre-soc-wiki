Dear OPF Board,

As you know the LibreSOC team have been working for over 3 years on a massive conceptual upgrade to the OpenPOWER ISA, based on Cray-Style Vectors, which will modernise it for today's 3D and VPU workloads, with an incidental side-effect of upgrading it for future supercomputing needs.  RISC-V has RVV, ARM has SVE2, x86 has AVX512, whilst OpenPOWER has an out-of-date SIMD ISA. It goes without saying that over the decades, SIMD has been demonstrated to be harmful.
