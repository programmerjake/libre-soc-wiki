# Building gem5

Official instructions are sparse.  Under exploratory development:

    apt-get install ccache build-essential scons libprotobuf-dev \
                    libpython2.7-dev protobuf-compiler
    scons -j16 build/POWER/gem5.opt

Two warnings are given about fallthrough on case statements... which are commented as such... and yet nobody thought to tell the compiler that.  TODO: investigate how to disable "-Werror" in scons...

# gcc powerpc cross-compiler

Note that this is not the same as the 64-bit powerpc64le or the 64-bit powerpc64 compiler

    apt-get install gcc-8-powerpc-linux-gnu g++-8-powerpc-linux-gnu

# libtcmalloc

Apparently installing libtcmalloc gives a 12% performance increase

    apt-get install libtcmalloc-minimal4
