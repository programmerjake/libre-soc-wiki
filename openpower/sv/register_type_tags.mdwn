[[!tag standards]]

# Register Type Tags

**UNDER CONSIDERATION**

A concept present in processors such as Texas Instruments DSPs and in the Mill Architecture to an advanced level, register "tags" allow the meaning and behaviour of instructions to change, polymorphically.

This for allows instructions originally designed to only be IEEE754 FP64 fir example to become IEEE754 FP128 or even complex mumbers.  With SVP64 supporting [[sv/remap]] it is not conceptually that much of a leap to support complex numbers, given that the hardware to do so is already in place.

# Complex numbers

Currently under discussion is which arithmetic operations should be supported: complex divide for example is known to be very tricky.  Add and subtract are easy: multiply involves four scalar multiplies, one add and one subtract. This fits within the REMAP system capabilities.
