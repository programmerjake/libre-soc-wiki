# Feed this script the output of objdump -M raw --no-show-raw-insn ppc-prog

# It will look for insns that can be represented in compressed mode,
# according to the encoding rules in the copcond dictionary below.

# Nothing is assumed as to the actual bit-encoding of the insns, this
# is just to experiment with insn selection and get a quick feedback
# loop for the encoding options in compressed mode.

# In this script, the computations of encoding modes and transitions
# are those for attempt 1 encoding, that encompasses:

# - a 16-bit insn (with 10-bit payload) that may switch to compressed
# mode or return to 32-bit mode;

# - 16-bit insns in compressed mode, each with 2 bits devoted to
# encoding one of the following possibilities:

# -- switch back to uncompressed mode at the next insn

# -- interpret the next insn in uncompressed mode, then return to
# compressed mode

# -- remain in 16-bit mode for the next insn

# - a 16-bit immediate insn in compressed mode, that must be followed
# by another compressed insn

# At (visible) entry points, mode is forced to return to uncompressed
# mode.  Every branch target must be in uncompressed mode as well, but
# this script does not enforce that.

# The entire code stream is printed, without any attempt to modify the
# addresses that go along with or in them; we only insert markers for
# the transition points, and for the compressed instructions.

# The really useful information is printed at the end: a summary of
# transition and compressed-insn counts, and the achieved compression
# rate.
