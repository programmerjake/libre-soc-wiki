| 0-1 |  2  |  3   4  |  description              |
| --- | --- |---------|-------------------------- |
| 00  |   0 |  ALL sz | normal mode                      |
| 01  | VLI |  ALL sz | VLSET mode                      |

Fields:

* **sz**  if predication is enabled will put zeros into the src CR when the predicate bit is zero.  otherwise the element is ignored or skipped, depending on context.
* **ALL** when set, all branch conditional tests must pass in order for
the branch to succeed.
* **VLI** In VLSET mode, VL is set equal (truncated) to the first branch
which succeeds.  If VLI (Vector Length Inclusive) is clear, VL is truncated
to *exclude* the current element, otherwise it is included.
