# SV Vector Operations.

The core OpenPOWER ISA was designed as scalar: SV provides a level of abstraction to add variable-length element-independent parallelism. However, certain classes of instructions only make sense in a Vector context: AVC512 conflictd for example.  This section includes such examples.  Many of them are from the RISC-V Vector ISA (with thanks to the efforts of RVV's contributors)
