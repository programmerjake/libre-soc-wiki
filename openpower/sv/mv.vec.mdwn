# move to/from vec2/3/4

See <https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230#c30>

Basic idea: mv operations where either the src or dest is specifically marked as having SUBVL apply to it, but, crucially, the *other* argument does *not*.

     mv.srcvec  r3, r4.vec2
     mv.destvec r2.vec4, r5

TODO: evaluate whether this will fit with [[mv.swizzle]] involved as well.
