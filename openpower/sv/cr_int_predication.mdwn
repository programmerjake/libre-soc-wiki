# New instructions for CR/INT predication

See:

* <https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=533>

Basic concept:

* CR-based instructions that perform simple AND/OR/XOR from all four bits
  of a CR to create a single bit value (0/1) in an integer register
* Inverse of the same, taking a single bit value (0/1) from an integer
  register to selectively target all four bits of a given CR
* Vectorisation of the same

Purpose:

* To provide a merged version of what is currently a multi-sequence of
  CR operations (crand, cror, crxor) with mfcr and mtcrf
* To provide a vectorised version of the same, suitable for advanced
  predication
