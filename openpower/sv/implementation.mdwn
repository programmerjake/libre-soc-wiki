# Implementation

This page covers and coordinates implementing SV.  The basic concept is
to go step-by-step through the [[sv/overview]] adding each feature,
one at a time.

# Code to convert

There are three projects:

* TestIssuer (the HDL)
* ISACaller (the python-based simulator)
* power-gem5 (a cycle accurate simulator)

Each of these needs to have SV augmentation, and the best way to
do it is if they are all done at the same time, implementing the same
incremental feature.

# Critical tasks

These are prerequisite tasks:

* power-gem5 automanagement, similar to pygdbmi for starting qemu
* c++, c and python macros for generating [[sv/svp64]] assembler
  (svp64 prefixes)
