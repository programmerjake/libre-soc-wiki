# TODO

<https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213>

* idea 1: modify cmp (and other CR generators?) with qualifiers that create single bit prefix vector into int reg
* idea 2: override CR SO field in vector form to be predicate bit per element
* idea 3: reading of predicates is from bits of int reg
* idea 4: SO CR field no longer overflow, contains copy of int reg predicate element bit (passed through).  when OE set?
