# Letter regarding ISAMUX / NS

## Why has Libre-SOC chosen PowerPC ?

For a hybrid CPU-VPU-GPU, intended for mass-volume adoption in tablets,
netbooks, chromebooks and industrial embedded (SBC) systems, our choice
was between Nyuzi, MIAOW, RISC-V, PowerPC, MIPS and OpenRISC.

Of all the options, the PowerPC architecture is more complete and far more
mature.  It also has a deeper adoption by Linux distributions.

Following IBM's release of the Power Architecture instruction set to the
Linux Foundation in August 2019 the barrier to using it is no more than
that of using RISC-V.  We are encouraged that the OpenPOWER Foundation is
supportive of what we are doing and helping, e.g by putting us in touch
with people who can help us.

## Summary

* We propose the standardisation of the way that the PowerPC Instruction
  Set Architecture (PPC ISA) is extended, enabling many different flavours
  within a well supported family to co-exist, long-term, without conflict,
  right across the board.
* This is about more than just our project. Our proposals will facilitate the use of PPC in novel or niche applications without breaking the PPC ISA into incompatible islands.
* PPC will gain a competitive market advantage by removing the need for separate VPU or GPU functions in RTL or ASICs thus enabling lower cost systems.
 Libre-SOC's project is to extend the PPC to integrate the GPU and VPU
  functionality directly as part of the PPC ISA (example: Broadcom
  VideoCore IV being based around extensions to an ARC core).
* Libre-SOC's extensions will be easily adopted, as the standard GNU/Linux
  distributions will very deliberately run unmodified on our ISA,
  including full compatibility with illegal instruction requirements.

## One CPU multiple ISAs

This is a quick overview of the way that we would like to add changes
that we are proposing to the PowerPC instruction set (ISA).  It is based on
a Open Standardisation of the way that existing "mode switches",
already found in the POWER instruction set, are added:

* FPSCR's "NI" bit, setting non-IEEE754 FP mode
* MSR's "LE" bit (and associated HILE bit), setting little-endian mode
* MSR's "SF" bit, setting either 32-bit or 64-bit mode
* PCR's "compatibility" bits 60-62, V2.05 V2.06 V2.07 mode

It is well-noted that unless each "mode switch" bit is set, the
alternative instructions (and functionality) are completely inaccessible,
and will result in "illegal instruction" traps being thrown.  This is
recognised as being critically important.

These bits effectively create multiple, incompatible run-time switchable ISAs
within one CPU.  They are selectable for the needs of the individual
program being run.

All of these are set by one instruction, that, once set, radically
changes the entire behaviour and characteristics of subsequent instructions.

With these (and other) long-established precedents already in POWER,
there is therefore essentially conceptually nothing new about what we
propose: we simply seek that the process by which such "switching" is
added is formalised and standardised, such that we (and others) have
a clear, standards-non-disruptive, atomic and non-intrusive path to
extend the POWER ISA for use in markets that it presently cannot enter.

We advocate that some of "mode-setting" (escape-sequencing) bits be binary
encoded, some unary encoded, some "offical", some "experimental" and some
"reserved".  The available space in a suitably-chosen SPR to be formalised,
and recommend the OpenPOWER Foundation be given the IANA-like role in
atomically allocating mode bits.

Instructions that we need to add, which are a normal part of GPUs,
include ATAN2, LOG, NORMALISE, YUV2RGB, Khronos Compliance FP mode
(different from both IEEE754 and "NI" mode), and many more.  Many of
these may turn out to be useful in a wider context: they however need
to be fully isolated behind "mode-setting".

Some mode-setting instructions are privileged, ie can only be set by
the kernel (eg 32 or 64 bit mode). The escape sequences that we propose
will be (have to be) usable without the need for an expensive system
call overhead (because some of the instructions needed will be in
extremely tight inner loops).

# About Libre-SOC Commercial Project

The Libre-SOC Commercial Product is a hybrid GPU-GPU-VPU intended for
mass-volume production.  There is no separate GPU, because the CPU
*is* the GPU.  There is no separate VPU, because the CPU *is* the GPU.
There is not even a separate pipeline: the CPU pipelines *are* the
GPU and VPU pipelines.

Closest equivalents include the ARC core (which has VPU extensions and
3D extensions in the form of Broadcom's VideoCore IV) and the ICubeCorp
IC3128.  Both are considered "hybrid" CPU-GPU-VPU processors.

"Normal" Commercial GPUs are entirely separate processors.  The development
cost and complexity purely in terms of Software Drivers alone is immense.
We reject that approach (and as a small team we do not have the resources
anyway).

With the project being Libre - not proprietary and secretive and never
to be published, ever - it is no good having the extensions as "custom"
because "custom" is specifically for the cases where the augmented
toolchain is never, under any circumstances, published and made public by
the proprietary company (and would never be accepted upstream anyway).
For business commercial reasons, Libre-SOC is the total opposite of this
proprietary, secretive approach.

Therefore, to meet our business objectives:

* As shown from Nyuzi and Larrabee, although ideally suited to high
  performance compute tasks, a "traditional" general-purpose full
  IEEE754-compliant Vector ISA (such as that in POWER9) is not an adequate
  basis for a commercially competitive GPU.  Nyuzi's conclusion is that
  using such general-purpose Vector ISAs results in reaching only 25%
  performance (or requiring 4-fold increase in power consumption) to
  achieve par with current commercial-grade GPUs.
* We are not going the "traditional" (separate custom GPU) route because
  it is not practical for a new team to design hardware and spend 8+
  man-years on massively complex inter-processor driver development as well
* We cannot meet our objectives with a "custom extension" because the
  financial burden on our team to maintain a total hard fork of not just
  toolchains, but also entire GNU/Linux Distros, is highly undesirable,
  and completely impractical (and Redhat would strongly object anyway)
* We cannot "go ahead anyway" because to do so would be highly irresponsible
  and cause massive disruption to the POWER community.

With all impractical options eliminated the only remaining responsible
option is to extend the POWER ISA in an atomically-managed (IANA-style)
formal fashion, whilst (critically and absolutely essentially) always
providing a PCR compatibility mode that is fully POWER compliant, including
all illegal instruction traps.
