# NLNet

With many thanks to <http://nlnet.nl> there are six inter-related grants, documented at the [[nlnet_proposals]] page.


NLNet is a Foundation and so does not have employees or enter into "work for hire" agreements.  It also will not give money to Corporations: only to Universities, individuals, and other Foundations.

They have an extremely knowledgeable International Tax Law specialist who has negotiated tax agreements with most countries in the world and consequently, subject to your Accountant checking with the law in your country, donations - and they are charitable donations - are extremely likely to be 100% tax-deductible.

The process is as follows:

* Proposals are submitted, reviewed, independently audited and (sometimes) approved.
* Accepted proposals submit a Project Plan listing a set of milestones, each of which has a fixed budget associated with it (note: not an hourly rate!)
* The Project Plan becomes part of a Memorandum of Understanding, signed by the team (note: not a contract!)
* On 100% completion of tasks *or subtasks* (which must add up ultimately to the total allocated budget) after approval by the project leader, an rfp (Request for Payment) is submitted by email to nlnet.
* The rfp is paid directly by bank transfer from NLNet *not by the Libre-SOC project*

Note that the lack of hourly rate and the lack of contractual obligation is what enables this to be considered charitable donations (and why Corporations may not be paid or involved).

This lack of contractual obligation also means that if the work is not done, then there is no penalty (for you). The only thing that happens is we grumble a bit and have to find someone else to do the work.

It is your responsibility to comply with local law and to consult an Accountant. Your Accountant will be able to confirm the International Tax Agreements, from the details and/or contact information on NLNet's website <https://nlnet.nl/foundation/ANBI.html>.
