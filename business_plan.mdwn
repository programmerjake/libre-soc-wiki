# An overview of the business

```What does it do and what makes it different?```

Our products are hybrid 3D and Video processors (SoCs) that are designed to be more efficient, use less power and be easier and less cost to integrate into products such as smartphones, netbooks, chromebooks, tablets, Industrial IoT, routers, IPTV and many more.

We achieve this by extending OpenPOWER with an innovative Vector ISA that merges 3D, Video and CPU into one single hybrid processor.  Complexity is reduced, time to market is reduced, power consumption is reduced.

A typical SoC licenses separate closed-source CPU and closed-source GPU, introducing huge complexity in the drivers and limiting innovation opportunities for the customer.  We provide the full source code even for the processor HDL, and full firmware source.  This allows customers to audit it in full (a critical requirement for secure environments).

# Goals.

```What does the business want to achieve? This should set some SMART objectives that will quickly show if the business is succeeding.```

    *Keep your goals SMART –
     Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.*
     Keep it simple – three big goals supported by clear
     targeted actions to get you there

Our very early goals are to develop a low-cost 180/130nm Gigabit router product with built-in cryptographic primitives and direct packet routing.  Timescale is end of Q4 2021 and using Google Skywater 130nm "Libre" MPW for a test ASIC

The second product is a 28nm (or lower) Quad-Core competitor to the ASpeed 2600, a Boot Management Console SoC used to manage Servers in Cloud Computing Data Centres world-wide.  The product will also be suitable as a SBC (Single Board Computer) with "Raspberry Pi" style interfaces and, with both USB-C, PCIe host and client, can act as an independent low-power affordable Graphics Card (a 3D version of the Volari X11) with modest 3D and Video capabilities for use typically in Data Centres and Embedded Industrial PCs, as well as a USB-C Graphics Adapter (similar to DisplayLink products). Timescale is end of Q2 2022.

The long-term products are intended to reach mass-volume adoption of 100 to 500 million units, using the latest geometries to gain high performance as well as power savings, primarily in the smartphone netbooks chromebooks tablets IoT and IPTV markets.  These to be planned and developed in overlap with the 28nm product, for delivery Q2 2023.

Additionally we seek to establish ourselves as a "Solutions Provider", developing custom-targetted high performance, high efficiency processors as part of full product design and delivery.

# Your audience and the market.

```Who will your business supply and how will it reach them? How big is the market and who are your key competitors?```


# Products and pricing.

```What will you be selling and how will your prices be set? How does this compare with your competitors?```

# Who is involved.

```Many investors say they invest as much in the people as they do in the business. Share some information about people’s roles, experience and passions.```

# Financials.

```Provide details about sales, costs, break-even points and where investment will come from. If you’re looking for people to invest, you should include information about likely returns. If you’re looking for ways to finance your business, crowdfunding, alternative finance and government funding are a good place to start.```
