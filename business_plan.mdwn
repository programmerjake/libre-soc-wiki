# Business Plan

# An overview of the business

```What does it do and what makes it different?```

# Goals.

```What does the business want to achieve? This should set some SMART objectives that will quickly show if the business is succeeding.```

# Your audience and the market.

```Who will your business supply and how will it reach them? How big is the market and who are your key competitors?```

# Products and pricing.

```What will you be selling and how will your prices be set? How does this compare with your competitors?```

# Who is involved.

```Many investors say they invest as much in the people as they do in the business. Share some information about people’s roles, experience and passions.```

# Financials.

```Provide details about sales, costs, break-even points and where investment will come from. If you’re looking for people to invest, you should include information about likely returns. If you’re looking for ways to finance your business, crowdfunding, alternative finance and government funding are a good place to start.```
