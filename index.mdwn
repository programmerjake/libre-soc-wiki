# Joining/Onboarding Process

This process probably needs some improvement, but the basic 
idea is to join the [mailing list](http://lists.libre-riscv.org/mailman/listinfo/libre-riscv-dev), introduce yourself,
and read through [recent posts](http://lists.libre-riscv.org/pipermail/libre-riscv-dev/).

The next thing you should do is read through the [bugs list](http://bugs.libre-riscv.org) and see if there are any bugs that pique your interest.

We do have funding available upon fixing bugs - we are also working on procuring more funding.

## Needed Skills

Most labor is currently being applied to developing the GPU portion of the LibreSOC.

We mainly need HDL engineers at the moment. Particularly those familiar with nMigen.

Also, individuals with experience in formal verification are quite welcome.

TODO: add a list of upcoming project tasks/milestones
