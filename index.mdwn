# Welcome to Libre-SoC ([provisionally renamed](http://lists.libre-riscv.org/pipermail/libre-riscv-dev/2020-January/003580.html) from Libre-RISCV)!

The Libre-SoC project is an effort to develop a complete modern capability
SoC (quad core, 800mhz, dual issue,
GPU, VPU, [an later and ML inference core] ) that is libre to the bedrock.

Libre has a very specific meaning and guarantees, where "open" does not.
See <https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html>
for an explanation of the distinction, and for additional examples:

# Why a Libre SOC?
Glad you asked! Read about the business and practical benefits of a LibreSOC below.

# Contact

The main contact point is the 
[mailing list](http://lists.libre-riscv.org/mailman/listinfo/libre-riscv-dev).
If you need to contact the sysadmin please use webmaster@libre-riscv.org

# Joining/Onboarding Process

This process probably needs some improvement: the basic 
idea is to join the
[mailing list](http://lists.libre-riscv.org/mailman/listinfo/libre-riscv-dev),
introduce yourself, and read through
[recent posts](http://lists.libre-riscv.org/pipermail/libre-riscv-dev/)
and the [[charter]].

The next thing you should do is read through the [bugs
list](http://bugs.libre-riscv.org) and see if there are any bugs that
pique your interest.

We do have funding available (see [[nlnet]]) upon completion of issues -
we are also working on procuring more funding which gets the project to
nanometre scale tapeout.

After all this, if you feel that Libre-SoC is a good cause that
you would like to contribute to, add yourself to the [[current_members]]
page, fill in some information about yourself, and join the mailing list
and say hello.

## Needed Skills

Most labor is currently being applied to developing the GPU portion of
the Libre-SoC.

The highest priority needed at the moment is a c++ engineer to work on
a MESA 3D driver. This will begin life similar to SwiftShader however
retaining the vectorisation and predication intrinsics as well as hardware accelerated opcodes (all of which SwiftShader lacks)

Medium to long-term we need HDL engineers. Particularly those familiar
with nMigen or just python.  Most of the techniques being used require
software engineering skills (OO design, polymorphism) than they do more
traditional HDL programming skills. Basically if you have experience in 2
of the following you'll do fine: python, nmigen, verilog/VHDL/gate-level
design. See [[HDL_workflow]]

Also, individuals with experience in formal mathematical verification
are quite welcome.

TODO: add a list of upcoming project tasks/milestones (link to
bugtracker).
