  <p>We're building a chip. A fast chip. A safe chip. A trusted chip.

  <p>A chip with lots of peripherals. And it's a VPU.  And it's a 3D GPU...

<h2 class="display-5">Why should I care?</h2>

With Libre-SOC, you can take complex algorithms usually intended for
power hungry servers with big fat GPUs, and run them on tiny devices
like smartwatches, cellphones, and pocket drones without changing your
code at all.

  <hr class="my-4">

<h2 class="display-5">Hasn't Somebody Already Done This?</h2>

To the best of our knowledge, no. The closest systems would be ARM Cortex
devices which currently offer mediocre GPU and OpenCL support. Often
times, it is quite difficult for customers to get their hands on the
drivers and install them due to their locked down nature. Libre-SOC is
providing our own Free/Libre drivers. Easy as 1, 2, 3!

# How Can I Help?

If you would like to fund us, see [[funding]]. We currently have some
funding and always appreciate more!  If you are a Corporation or an
individual you can donate tax-free to NLNet, and they can in turn gift
our developers.  Contact lkcl@lkcl.net for more information.

# How Can I Help as a Developer? <a name="help_as_developer"></a>

If you want to write code with us (and receive donations from NLNet
for doing so), keep reading.  If you want to *learn*
so that you can write code with us, see "How can I learn" section,
below.  If there is anything else,
just get in touch on the list, there is plenty to do.

1. First, join the
  [mailing list](http://lists.libre-soc.org/mailman/listinfo/libre-soc-dev),
  introduce yourself (people will happily say "hello" back) and
  the Libera IRC channel
  (#libre-soc at irc.libera.chat port 6697, see
https://libera.chat/guides/connect), [logs here](https://libre-soc.org/irclog/latest.log.html).
  Read through
  [recent posts](http://lists.libre-soc.org/pipermail/libre-soc-dev/)
  and the [[charter]], ask questions if you have any and let everyone know,
  on the list that you're happy with it and agree to it.
2. The next thing you should do is read through the
  [bugs list](http://bugs.libre-soc.org) and
  see if there are any bugs that pique your interest.
  A fascinating way to do that is to view the
  [dependency graph](https://bugs.libre-soc.org/showdependencygraph.cgi?id=1&display=web&rankdir=LR)
3. After that, go ahead and take a look at the
   [git repositories](https://git.libre-soc.org).
4. If you plan to do HDL work, you should familiarize yourself with our
  [[HDL_workflow]].  If you would like to help with the ASIC layout,
  see [[HDL_workflow/coriolis2]]
5. We do have funding available (see [[nlnet]]) upon completion of issues -
  we are also working on procuring more funding which gets the project to
  nanometre scale tapeout.
6. After all this, if you feel that Libre-SOC is a something
  that you would like to contribute to, add yourself to the
  [current_members](about_us) page, fill in some information about yourself,
  and join the mailing list and say hello.

Also note that you can edit this wiki.  You can experiment in the [[Sandbox]].

## Quick peek at the code

Here is an example process of how to play with the soc code.  The last
step you will have needed to install yosys:

    pip3 install virtualenv requests
    mkdir ~/.virtualenvs && cd ~/.virtualenvs
    python3 -m venv libresoc
    source ~/.virtualenvs/libresoc/bin/activate
    
    cd ~; mkdir libresoc; cd libresoc
    git clone https://git.libre-soc.org/git/nmigen.git
    git clone https://git.libre-soc.org/git/nmigen-soc.git
    git clone https://git.libre-soc.org/git/nmutil.git
    git clone https://git.libre-soc.org/git/openpower-isa.git
    git clone https://git.libre-soc.org/git/c4m-jtag.git
    git clone https://git.libre-soc.org/git/ieee754fpu.git
    git clone https://git.libre-soc.org/git/soc.git
    
    cd nmigen; python setup.py develop; cd ..
    cd nmigen-soc; python setup.py develop; cd ..
    cd c4m-jtag; python setup.py develop; cd ..
    cd nmutil; make develop; cd ..
    cd openpower-isa; make develop; cd ..
    cd ieee754fpu; make develop; cd ..
    cd soc; make gitupdate; make develop
    
    python3 src/soc/decoder/power_decoder.py
    yosys -p "read_ilang decoder.il; show dec31" 

The full install process may be automated using scripts found
here: <https://git.libre-soc.org/?p=dev-env-setup.git;a=summary>
which you can clone with:

    git clone https://git.libre-soc.org/git/dev-env-setup.git

A convenient page which gives step-by-step instructions is: 
[[HDL_workflow/devscripts]]

## How can I learn?

The whole purpose of this project is to be a learning environment as well
as an actual business.  If you want to learn how to do ASIC design, with
a view to contributing or starting your own ASIC business, start here:
[[3d_gpu/tutorial]]. Yes, really: do not let anyone tell you that you
can't learn this stuff too.

Along the way, if you find any [[resources]] or links that you found
particularly helpful, please add them to that page so that other people
can also benefit (and you have a place to remember them, too).

## Needed Skills

Most labor is currently being applied to developing the GPU portion of
the Libre-SOC.

Our highest priority short-term and medium-term: we need HDL engineers.
Particularly those familiar
with nMigen or just python.  Most of the techniques being used require
software engineering skills (OO design, polymorphism) than they do more
traditional HDL programming skills. Basically if you have experience in 2
of the following you'll do fine: python, nmigen, verilog/VHDL/gate-level
design. See [[HDL_workflow]]

We also need to find a c++ engineer with compiler experience to work on
a MESA 3D driver. This will begin life similar to SwiftShader however
retaining the vectorisation and predication intrinsics then adding
hardware accelerated opcodes (all of which SwiftShader lacks)

Also, individuals with experience in formal mathematical verification
are quite welcome.
