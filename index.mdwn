# Welcome to Libre-SoC ([provisionally renamed](http://lists.libre-riscv.org/pipermail/libre-riscv-dev/2020-January/003580.html) from Libre-RISCV)!

LibreSOC strives to deliver a fully capable and competitive Libre integrated System on Chip. We want to maximize the degree of trust a customer can place in his or her processor. We do this by providing the customer the freedom to  study, modify, and redistribute the SOC source from HDL to VLSI.

Right now, we're targeting a (quad core, 800mhz, dual issue, GPU, VPU, [and later an ML inference core] ) SOC.

## Why a Libre SOC?

Its quite hard to guarantee that a performant processors(think pipelined, out-of-order) are functionally perfectly correct. In fact, it often turns out that they [aren’t](https://meltdownattack.com).

There are entire [dissertations](http://www.kroening.com/diss/diss-kroe.pdf) dedicated to the subject matter of merely functionally verifying a pipeline(this doesn’t even consider out of order execution).

Given the fact that performant bug-free processors no longer exist, how can you trust your processor? The next best thing is to have access to a processor’s design files. Not only have access to them, you must have the freedom to study and improve them.

Such a processor is referred to as a Libre processor. However, processors themselves are only a part of the picture. Nowadays, most contemporary computing tasks involve artificial intelligence, media consumption, wireless connectivity, etc.

## But Why do I need a LibreSOC?
Its entirely possible that you're OK with the fact that modern processors have
[backdoors](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3220476/researchers-say-now-you-too-can-disable-intel-me-backdoor-thanks-to-the-nsa.html) that bad actors 
regularly exploit.

But beyond the contemporary ever increasing cry for privacy, is a very real need for reliable safety critical processors(think airplane, smart car, pacemaker...).
LibreSOC poses to you that it is impossible to trust a processor in a safety critical environment without both access
to that processor's source and a cycle accurate HDL simulator that guarantees developers their code behaves as they 
expect. An ISA level simulator is no longer satisfactory.

# Join us in Realizing the First Market Ready LibreSOC!

First. join the
[mailing list](http://lists.libre-riscv.org/mailman/listinfo/libre-riscv-dev),
introduce yourself, and read through
[recent posts](http://lists.libre-riscv.org/pipermail/libre-riscv-dev/)
and the [[charter]].

The next thing you should do is read through the [bugs
list](http://bugs.libre-riscv.org) and see if there are any bugs that
pique your interest.

We do have funding available (see [[nlnet]]) upon completion of issues -
we are also working on procuring more funding which gets the project to
nanometre scale tapeout.

After all this, if you feel that Libre-SoC is a good cause that
you would like to contribute to, add yourself to the [[current_members]]
page, fill in some information about yourself, and join the mailing list
and say hello.

Also note that you can edit this wiki. See the last section of this page.

## Needed Skills

Most labor is currently being applied to developing the GPU portion of
the Libre-SoC.

The highest priority needed at the moment is a c++ engineer to work on
a MESA 3D driver. This will begin life similar to SwiftShader however
retaining the vectorisation and predication intrinsics as well as hardware accelerated opcodes (all of which SwiftShader lacks)

Medium to long-term we need HDL engineers. Particularly those familiar
with nMigen or just python.  Most of the techniques being used require
software engineering skills (OO design, polymorphism) than they do more
traditional HDL programming skills. Basically if you have experience in 2
of the following you'll do fine: python, nmigen, verilog/VHDL/gate-level
design. See [[HDL_workflow]]

Also, individuals with experience in formal mathematical verification
are quite welcome.
