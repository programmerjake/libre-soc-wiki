# Mailman

has been hopelessly hacked into oblivion with the addition of
recaptcha.  https://ftp.libre-soc.org/recaptcha-mashed-into-oblivion.tgz

this was itself out-of-date due to python-recaptcha itself being
out-of-date

also remember to add this:

     ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/recaptcha \
           /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/recaptcha

don't ask.
