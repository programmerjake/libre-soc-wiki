# Hybrid 3D GPU / CPU / VPU

Creating a trustworthy processor for the world.

Our [[3d_gpu/business_objectives]]

Note: this is a **hybrid** CPU, VPU and GPU.  It is not, as many news articles
are implying, a "dedicated exclusive GPU".  The option exists to *create*
a stand-alone GPU product (contact us if this is a product that you want).
Our primary goal is to design a **complete** all-in-one processor
(System-on-a-Chip) that happens to include libre-licensed VPU and GPU
accelerated instructions as part of the actual - main - CPU itself.  This greatly simplifies driver development, applications integration and debugging, reducing costs and time to market in the process.

We seek investors, sponsors (whose contributions thanks to NLNet may be
tax-deductible), engineers and potential customers, who are
interested, as a first product, in the creation and use of an entirely
libre low-power mobile class system-on-a-chip
[[shakti/m_class/]].  Comparative benchmark
performance, pincount and price is the Allwinner A64, except that the
power budget target is 2.5 watts in a 16x16mm 320 to 360 pin 0.8mm
FBGA package.  Instead of single-issue higher clock rate, the design is
multi-issue, aiming for around 800mhz.

The lower pincount, lower power, and higher BGA pitch is all to reduce
the cost of product development when it comes to PCB design and layout:

* Above 4 watts requires metal packages, greater attention to thermal
  management in the PCB design and layout, and much pricier PMICs.
* 0.6mm pitch BGA and below requires much more expensive PCB manufacturing
  equipment and more costly PCBA techniques.
* Above 600 pins begins to reduce production yields as well as increase
  the cost of testing and packaging.

We can look at larger higher-power ASICs either later or, if funding
is made available, immediately.

Recent applications to NLNet (Oct 2019) are for a test chip in 180nm,
64 bit, single core dual issue, around 300 to 350mhz.  This will provide
the confidence to go to higher geometries, as well as be a commercially
viable embedded product in its own right. Tapeout deadline is Oct 2020.
