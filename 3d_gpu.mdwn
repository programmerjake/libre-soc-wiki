# RISC-V 3D GPU / CPU / VPU

Note: this is a **hybrid** CPU, VPU and GPU.  It is not, as many news articles
are implying, a "dedicated exclusive GPU".  The option exists to **create**
a stand-alone GPU product.  It is being *designed* to be a **complete**
all-in-one processor (System-on-a-Chip).

We seek investors, sponsors, engineers and potential customers, who are
interested in the creation and use of an entirely libre low-power mobile
class system-on-a-chip.  Comparative benchmark performance, pincount and
price is the Allwinner A64, except that the power budget target is 2.5 watts
in a 16x16mm 320 to 360 pin 0.8mm FBGA package.
