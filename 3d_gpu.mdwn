## You know how...

You know how for computers, you really have no idea how they work? And
how you keep having to replace them with upgrades?  Turns out that
it's very difficult for medium-sized businesses to design lower-cost products
because the only cheap processors (almost always from China) do not respect
Copyright law, provide almost zero documentation, and even Intel processors
are known to have spying backdoor co-processors in them?

## Well what we do is...

Well, what we do is: design 3D-capable efficient processors based on
full transparency.  All source code, right to the bedrock, hardware
and software.  We don't tell customers "trust us", we say "go have a
specialist audit the full source, independently".  If there's ever
some documentation missing, the customer can check for themselves when
designing *their* product around ours.

## In fact...

In fact, one customer that we're talking to is so fed up with a Chinese-based
$35 component that they are using in a $3000 product, where they are having
to spend considerable resources to *reverse-engineer* the China component,
they're willing to bet on our product even before we've
completed it, they believe in the approach and that our design can help
them out that much.

## What we do

Design modular computing appliances based around "Computer Card" standards
where the "Computer Card" may be upgraded, swapped, shared, re-programmed,
re-purposed, and re-used.

## Benefits

Almost too numerous to describe.  Not just the right to repair: the right
to redesign and many more.  "Computer Card" has the data *and* the apps on
it, so goodbye file incompatibility: just move **the whole computer** from a
TV slot to a Laptop slot to a Tablet slot to a Desktop slot.  Also the cost
savings and environmental savings are enormous.  Keep the same $300 Laptop
"Housing" for 15 years, upgrade its parts over time, and not only buy a
new Computer Card for $30 every 2 years, keep the old one as a "spare",
give it to the kids, re-program it for watching Videos, the list is endless.

## Feelings

Every person we've spoken to, once they get around the confusion of the
idea of a "Computer" being inside a "Card" rather than "part of A Laptop",
has loved both the environmental as well as the cost savings.

# Hybrid 3D GPU / CPU / VPU

Creating a trustworthy processor for the world.

Our [[3d_gpu/business_objectives]]

Note: this is a **hybrid** CPU, VPU and GPU.  It is not, as many news articles
are implying, a "dedicated exclusive GPU".  The option exists to *create*
a stand-alone GPU product (contact us if this is a product that you want).
Our primary goal is to design a **complete** all-in-one processor
(System-on-a-Chip) that happens to include libre-licensed VPU and GPU
accelerated instructions as part of the actual - main - CPU itself.  This greatly simplifies driver development, applications integration and debugging, reducing costs and time to market in the process.

We seek investors, sponsors (whose contributions thanks to NLNet may be
tax-deductible), engineers and potential customers, who are
interested, as a first product, in the creation and use of an entirely
libre low-power mobile class system-on-a-chip
[[shakti/m_class/]].  Comparative benchmark
performance, pincount and price is the Allwinner A64, except that the
power budget target is 2.5 watts in a 16x16mm 320 to 360 pin 0.8mm
FBGA package.  Instead of single-issue higher clock rate, the design is
multi-issue, aiming for around 800mhz.

The lower pincount, lower power, and higher BGA pitch is all to reduce
the cost of product development when it comes to PCB design and layout:

* Above 4 watts requires metal packages, greater attention to thermal
  management in the PCB design and layout, and much pricier PMICs.
* 0.6mm pitch BGA and below requires much more expensive PCB manufacturing
  equipment and more costly PCBA techniques.
* Above 600 pins begins to reduce production yields as well as increase
  the cost of testing and packaging.

We can look at larger higher-power ASICs either later or, if funding
is made available, immediately.

Recent applications to NLNet (Oct 2019) are for a test chip in 180nm,
64 bit, single core dual issue, around 300 to 350mhz.  This will provide
the confidence to go to higher geometries, as well as be a commercially
viable embedded product in its own right. Tapeout deadline is Oct 2020.
