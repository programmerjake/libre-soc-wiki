# RISC-V 3D GPU / CPU / VPU

Note: this is a **hybrid** CPU, VPU and GPU.  It is not, as many news articles
are implying, a "dedicated exclusive GPU".  The option exists to **create**
a stand-alone GPU product (contact us if this is a product that you want).
Our primary goal is to design a **complete** all-in-one processor
(System-on-a-Chip) that happens to include a libre-licensed VPU and GPU.

We seek investors, sponsors, engineers and potential customers, who are
interested, as a first product, in the creation and use of an entirely
libre low-power mobile class system-on-a-chip.  Comparative benchmark
performance, pincount and price is the Allwinner A64, except that the
power budget target is 2.5 watts in a 16x16mm 320 to 360 pin 0.8mm
FBGA package.  Instead of single-issue higher clock rate, the design is
multi-issue, aiming for around 800mhz.

The lower pincount, lower power, and higher BGA pitch is all to reduce
the cost of product development when it comes to PCB design and layout:

* Above 4 watts requires metal packages, greater attention to thermal
  management in the PCB design and layout, and much pricier PMICs.
* 0.6mm pitch BGA and below requires much more expensive PCB manufacturing
  equipment and more costly PCBA techniques.
* Above 600 pins begins to reduce production yields as well as increase
  the cost of testing and packaging.

We can look at larger higher-power ASICs either later or, if funding
is made available, immediately.

Recent applications to NLNet (Oct 2019) are for a test chip in 180nm, 64 bit, single core dual issue, around 300 to 350mhz.  This will provide the confidence to go to higher geometries, as well as be a commercially viable embedded product in its own right.
