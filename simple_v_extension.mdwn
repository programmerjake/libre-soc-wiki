# Variable-width Variable-packed SIMD / Simple-V / Parallelism Extension Proposal

[[!toc ]]

This proposal exists so as to be able to satisfy several disparate
requirements: power-conscious, area-conscious, and performance-conscious
designs all pull an ISA and its implementation in different conflicting
directions, as do the specific intended uses for any given implementation.

Additionally, the existing P (SIMD) proposal and the V (Vector) proposals,
whilst each extremely powerful in their own right and clearly desirable,
are also:

* Clearly independent in their origins (Cray and AndeStar v3 respectively)
  so need work to adapt to the RISC-V ethos and paradigm
* Are sufficiently large so as to make adoption (and exploration for
  analysis and review purposes) prohibitively expensive
* Both contain partial duplication of pre-existing RISC-V instructions
  (an undesirable characteristic)
* Both have independent and disparate methods for introducing parallelism
  at the instruction level.
* Both require that their respective parallelism paradigm be implemented
  along-side and integral to their respective functionality *or not at all*.
* Both independently have methods for introducing parallelism that
  could, if separated, benefit
  *other areas of RISC-V not just DSP or Floating-point respectively*.

Therefore it makes a huge amount of sense to have a means and method
of introducing instruction parallelism in a flexible way that provides
implementors with the option to choose exactly where they wish to offer
performance improvements and where they wish to optimise for power
and/or area (and if that can be offered even on a per-operation basis that
would provide even more flexibility).

Additionally it makes sense to *split out* the parallelism inherent within
each of P and V, and to see if each of P and V then, in *combination* with
a "best-of-both" parallelism extension, could be added on *on top* of
this proposal, to topologically provide the exact same functionality of
each of P and V.

Furthermore, an additional goal of this proposal is to reduce the number
of opcodes utilised by each of P and V as they currently stand, leveraging
existing RISC-V opcodes where possible, and also potentially allowing
P and V to make use of Compressed Instructions as a result.

**TODO**: reword this to better suit this document:

Having looked at both P and V as they stand, they're _both_ very much
"separate engines" that, despite both their respective merits and
extremely powerful features, don't really cleanly fit into the RV design
ethos (or the flexible extensibility) and, as such, are both in danger
of not being widely adopted.  I'm inclined towards recommending:

* splitting out the DSP aspects of P-SIMD to create a single-issue DSP
* splitting out the polymorphism, esoteric data types (GF, complex
  numbers) and unusual operations of V to create a single-issue "Esoteric
  Floating-Point" extension
* splitting out the loop-aspects, vector aspects and data-width aspects
  of both P and V to a *new* "P-SIMD / Simple-V" and requiring that they
  apply across *all* Extensions, whether those be DSP, M, Base, V, P -
  everything.

**TODO**: propose overflow registers be actually one of the integer regs
(flowing to multiple regs).

**TODO**: propose "mask" (predication) registers likewise.  combination with
standard RV instructions and overflow registers extremely powerful

## CSRs marking registers as Vector

A 32-bit CSR would be needed (1 bit per integer register) to indicate
whether a register was, if referred to, implicitly to be treated as
a vector.

A second 32-bit CSR would be needed (1 bit per floating-point register)
to indicate whether a floating-point register was to be treated as a
vector.

In this way any standard (current or future) operation involving
register operands may detect if the operation is to be vector-vector,
vector-scalar or scalar-scalar (standard) simply through a single
bit test.

## CSR vector-length and CSR SIMD packed-bitwidth

**TODO** analyse each of these:

* splitting out the loop-aspects, vector aspects and data-width aspects
* integer reg 0 *and* fp reg0 share CSR vlen 0 *and* CSR packed-bitwidth 0
* integer reg 1 *and* fp reg1 share CSR vlen 1 *and* CSR packed-bitwidth 1
* ....
* .... 

instead:

* CSR vlen 0 *and* CSR packed-bitwidth 0 register contain extra bits
  specifying an *INDEX* of WHICH int/fp register they refer to
* CSR vlen 1 *and* CSR packed-bitwidth 1 register contain extra bits
  specifying an *INDEX* of WHICH int/fp register they refer to
* ...
* ...

Have to be very *very* careful about not implementing too few of those
(or too many).  Assess implementation impact on decode latency.  Is it
worth it?

Implementation of the latter:

Operation involving (referring to) register M:

    bitwidth = default # default for opcode?
    vectorlen = 1 # scalar
    
    for (o = 0, o < 2, o++)
      if (CSR-Vector_registernum[o] == M)
          bitwidth = CSR-Vector_bitwidth[o]
          vectorlen = CSR-Vector_len[o]
          break

and for the former it would simply be:

    bitwidth = CSR-Vector_bitwidth[M]
    vectorlen = CSR-Vector_len[M]

Alternatives:

* One single "global" vector-length CSR

## Stride

**TODO**: propose two LOAD/STORE offset CSRs, which mark a particular
register as being "if you use this reg in LOAD/STORE, use the offset
amount CSRoffsN (N=0,1) instead of treating LOAD/STORE as contiguous".
can be used for matrix spanning.

> For LOAD/STORE, could a better option be to interpret the offset in the

> t5 = *(t2+24), t6 = *(t2+32)?  Perhaps include a bit in the

> memory accesses? 

So there would be an instruction like this:

| SETOFF | On=rN | OBank={float|int} | Smode={offs|unit} | OFFn=rM |
| opcode | 5 bit | 1 bit             | 1 bit             | 5 bit, OFFn=XLEN |


which would mean:

* CSR-Offset register n <= (float|int) register number N
* CSR-Offset Stride-mode = offset or unit
* CSR-Offset amount register n = contents of register M

LOAD rN, ldoffs(rM) would then be (assuming packed bit-width not set):

    offs = 0
    stride = 1
    vector-len = CSR-Vector-length register N
  
    for (o = 0, o < 2, o++)
      if (CSR-Offset register o == M)
          offs = CSR-Offset amount register o
          if CSR-Offset Stride-mode == offset:
              stride = ldoffs
          break
   
    for (i = 0, i < vector-len; i++)
      r[N+i] = mem[(offs*i + r[M+i])*stride]

# Analysis and discussion of Vector vs SIMD

There are four combined areas between the two proposals that help with
parallelism without over-burdening the ISA with a huge proliferation of
instructions:

* Fixed vs variable parallelism (fixed or variable "M" in SIMD)
* Implicit vs fixed instruction bit-width (integral to instruction or not)
* Implicit vs explicit type-conversion (compounded on bit-width)
* Implicit vs explicit inner loops.
* Masks / tagging (selecting/preventing certain indexed elements from execution)

The pros and cons of each are discussed and analysed below.

## Fixed vs variable parallelism length

In David Patterson and Andrew Waterman's analysis of SIMD and Vector
ISAs, the analysis comes out clearly in favour of (effectively) variable
length SIMD.  As SIMD is a fixed width, typically 4, 8 or in extreme cases
16 or 32 simultaneous operations, the setup, teardown and corner-cases of SIMD
are extremely burdensome except for applications whose requirements
*specifically* match the *precise and exact* depth of the SIMD engine.

Thus, SIMD, no matter what width is chosen, is never going to be acceptable
for general-purpose computation, and in the context of developing a
general-purpose ISA, is never going to satisfy 100 percent of implementors.

That basically leaves "variable-length vector" as the clear *general-purpose*
winner, at least in terms of greatly simplifying the instruction set,
reducing the number of instructions required for any given task, and thus
reducing power consumption for the same.

## Implicit vs fixed instruction bit-width

SIMD again has a severe disadvantage here, over Vector: huge proliferation
of specialist instructions that target 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, and
have to then have operations *for each and between each*.  It gets very
messy, very quickly.

The V-Extension on the other hand proposes to set the bit-width of
future instructions on a per-register basis, such that subsequent instructions
involving that register are *implicitly* of that particular bit-width until
otherwise changed or reset.

This has some extremely useful properties, without being particularly
burdensome to implementations, given that instruction decode already has
to direct the operation to a correctly-sized width ALU engine, anyway.

Not least: in places where an ISA was previously constrained (due for
whatever reason, including limitations of the available operand spcace),
implicit bit-width allows the meaning of certain operations to be
type-overloaded *without* pollution or alteration of frozen and immutable
instructions, in a fully backwards-compatible fashion.

## Implicit and explicit type-conversion

The Draft 2.3 V-extension proposal has (deprecated) polymorphism to help
deal with over-population of instructions, such that type-casting from
integer (and floating point) of various sizes is automatically inferred
due to "type tagging" that is set with a special instruction.  A register
will be *specifically* marked as "16-bit Floating-Point" and, if added
to an operand that is specifically tagged as "32-bit Integer" an implicit
type-conversion will take placce *without* requiring that type-conversion
to be explicitly done with its own separate instruction.

However, implicit type-conversion is not only quite burdensome to
implement (explosion of inferred type-to-type conversion) but also is
never really going to be complete.  It gets even worse when bit-widths
also have to be taken into consideration.

Overall, type-conversion is generally best to leave to explicit
type-conversion instructions, or in definite specific use-cases left to
be part of an actual instruction (DSP or FP)

## Zero-overhead loops vs explicit loops

The initial Draft P-SIMD Proposal by Chuanhua Chang of Andes Technology
contains an extremely interesting feature: zero-overhead loops.  This
proposal would basically allow an inner loop of instructions to be
repeated indefinitely, a fixed number of times.

Its specific advantage over explicit loops is that the pipeline in a
DSP can potentially be kept completely full *even in an in-order
implementation*.  Normally, it requires a superscalar architecture and
out-of-order execution capabilities to "pre-process" instructions in order
to keep ALU pipelines 100% occupied.

This very simple proposal offers a way to increase pipeline activity in the
one key area which really matters: the inner loop.

## Mask and Tagging (Predication)

Tagging (aka Masks aka Predication) is a pseudo-method of implementing
simplistic branching in a parallel fashion, by allowing execution on
elements of a vector to be switched on or off depending on the results
of prior operations in the same array position.

The reason for considering this is simple: by *definition* it
is not possible to perform individual parallel branches in a SIMD
(Single-Instruction, **Multiple**-Data) context.  Branches (modifying
of the Program Counter) will result in *all* parallel data having
a different instruction executed on it: that's just the definition of
SIMD, and it is simply unavoidable.

So these are the ways in which conditional execution may be implemented:

* explicit compare and branch: BNE x, y -> offs would jump offs
  instructions if x was not equal to y
* explicit store of tag condition: CMP x, y -> tagbit
* implicit (condition-code) ADD results in a carry, carry bit implicitly
  (or sometimes explicitly) goes into a "tag" (mask) register

The first of these is a "normal" branch method, which is flat-out impossible
to parallelise without look-ahead and effectively rewriting instructions.
This would defeat the purpose of RISC.

The latter two are where parallelism becomes easy to do without complexity:
every operation is modified to be "conditionally executed" (in an explicit
way directly in the instruction format *or* implicitly).

RVV (Vector-Extension) proposes to have *explicit* storing of the compare
in a tag/mask register, and to *explicitly* have every vector operation
*require* that its operation be "predicated" on the bits within an
explicitly-named tag/mask register.

SIMD (P-Extension) has not yet published precise documentation on what its
schema is to be: there is however verbal indication at the time of writing
that:

> The "compare" instructions in the DSP/SIMD ISA proposed by Andes will
> be executed using the same compare ALU logic for the base ISA with some
> minor modifications to handle smaller data types. The function will not
> be duplicated.

This is an *implicit* form of predication as the base RV ISA does not have
condition-codes or predication.  By adding a CSR it becomes possible
to also tag certain registers as "predicated if referenced as a destination".
Example:

    // in future operations if r0 is the destination use r5 as 
    // the PREDICATION register
    IMPLICICSRPREDICATE r0, r5
    // store the compares in r5 as the PREDICATION register 
    CMPEQ8 r5, r1, r2
    // r0 is used here.  ah ha!  that means it's predicated using r5! 
    ADD8 r0, r1, r3

With enough registers (and there are enough registers) some fairly
complex predication can be set up and yet still execute without significant
stalling, even in a simple non-superscalar architecture.

### Retro-fitting Predication into branch-explicit ISA

One of the goals of this parallelism proposal is to avoid instruction
duplication.  However, with the base ISA having been designed explictly
to *avoid* condition-codes entirely, shoe-horning predication into it
bcomes quite challenging.

However what if all branch instructions, if referencing a vectorised
register, were instead given *completely new analogous meanings* that
resulted in a parallel bit-wise predication register being set?  This
would have to be done for both C.BEQZ and C.BNEZ, as well as BEQ, BNE,
BLT and BGE.

We might imagine that FEQ, FLT and FLT would also need to be converted,
however these are effectively *already* in the precise form needed and
do not need to be converted *at all*!  The difference is that FEQ, FLT
and FLE *specifically* write a 1 to an integer register if the condition
holds, and 0 if not.  All that needs to be done here is to say, "if
the integer register is tagged with a bit that says it is a predication
register, the **bit** in the integer register is set based on the
current vector index" instead.

There is, in the standard Conditional Branch instruction, more than
adequate space to interpret it in a similar fashion:

[[!table  data="""
  31    |30 ..... 25 |24 ... 20 | 19 ... 15 | 14 ...... 12 | 11 .......  8 |      7  | 6 ....... 0 |
imm[12] | imm[10:5]  |        rs2 |     rs1 |       funct3 |      imm[4:1] | imm[11] |    opcode   |
 1      |        6   |      5   |      5    |       3      |     4         |  1      |   7         |
   offset[12,10:5]  ||    src2  |    src1   |  BEQ         |    offset[11,4:1]      || BRANCH      |
"""]]

This would become:

[[!table  data="""
  31    |30 ..... 25 |24 ... 20 | 19 ... 15 | 14 ...... 12 | 11 .......  8 |      7  | 6 ....... 0 |
imm[12] | imm[10:5]  |        rs2 |     rs1 |       funct3 |      imm[4:1] | imm[11] |    opcode   |
 1      |        6   |      5   |      5    |       3      |     4         |  1      |   7         |
   reserved         ||    src2  |    src1   |  BEQ         |   predicate rs3        || BRANCH      |
"""]]

Similarly the C.BEQZ and C.BNEZ instruction format may be retro-fitted,
with the interesting side-effect that there is space within what is presently
the "immediate offset" field to reinterpret that to add in not only a bit
field to distinguish between floating-point compare and integer compare,
not only to add in a second source register, but also use some of the bits as
a predication target as well.

[[!table  data="""
15 ...... 13 | 12 ...........  10 | 9..... 7 | 6 ................. 2 | 1 .. 0 |
   funct3    |       imm          |   rs10   |         imm           |   op   |
      3      |         3          |    3     |           5           |   2    |
   C.BEQZ    |   offset[8,4:3]    |   src    |   offset[7:6,2:1,5]   |   C1   |
"""]]

Now uses the CS format:

[[!table  data="""
15 ...... 13 | 12 ...........  10 | 9..... 7 | 6 .. 5 | 4......... 2 | 1 .. 0 |
   funct3    |       imm          |   rs10   |  imm   |              |   op   |
      3      |         3          |    3     |  2     |  3           |   2    |
   C.BEQZ    |   predicate rs3    |   src1   |  I/F B | src2         |   C1   |
"""]]

Bit 6 would be decoded as "operation refers to Integer or Float" including
interpreting src1 and src2 accordingly as outlined in Table 12.2 of the
"C" Standard, version 2.0,
whilst Bit 5 would allow the operation to be extended, in combination with
funct3 = 110 or 111: a combination of four distinct comparison operators.

## Conclusions

In the above sections the five different ways where parallel instruction
execution has closely and loosely inter-related implications for the ISA and
for implementors, were outlined.  The pluses and minuses came out as
follows:

* Fixed vs variable parallelism: <b>variable</b>
* Implicit (indirect) vs fixed (integral) instruction bit-width: <b>indirect</b>
* Implicit vs explicit type-conversion: <b>explicit</b>
* Implicit vs explicit inner loops: <b>implicit</b>
* Tag or no-tag: <b>Complex and needs further thought</b>

In particular: variable-length vectors came out on top because of the
high setup, teardown and corner-cases associated with the fixed width
of SIMD.  Implicit bit-width helps to extend the ISA to escape from
former limitations and restrictions (in a backwards-compatible fashion),
and implicit (zero-overhead) loops provide a means to keep pipelines
potentially 100% occupied *without* requiring a super-scalar or out-of-order
architecture.

Constructing a SIMD/Simple-Vector proposal based around even only these four
(five?) requirements would therefore seem to be a logical thing to do.

# Instruction Format

**TODO** *basically borrow from both P and V, which should be quite simple
to do, with the exception of Tag/no-tag, which needs a bit more
thought.  V's Section 17.19 of Draft V2.3 spec is reminiscent of B's BGS
gather-scatterer, and, if implemented, could actually be a really useful
way to span 8-bit up to 64-bit groups of data, where BGS as it stands
and described by Clifford does **bits** of up to 16 width.  Lots to
look at and investigate!*

# Note on implementation of parallelism

One extremely important aspect of this proposal is to respect and support
implementors desire to focus on power, area or performance.  In that regard,
it is proposed that implementors be free to choose whether to implement
the Vector (or variable-width SIMD) parallelism as sequential operations
with a single ALU, fully parallel (if practical) with multiple ALUs, or
a hybrid combination of both.

In Broadcom's Videocore-IV, they chose hybrid, and called it "Virtual
Parallelism".  They achieve a 16-way SIMD at an **instruction** level
by providing a combination of a 4-way parallel ALU *and* an externally
transparent loop that feeds 4 sequential sets of data into each of the
4 ALUs.

Also in the same core, it is worth noting that particularly uncommon
but essential operations (Reciprocal-Square-Root for example) are
*not* part of the 4-way parallel ALU but instead have a *single* ALU.
Under the proposed Vector (varible-width SIMD) implementors would
be free to do precisely that: i.e. free to choose *on a per operation
basis* whether and how much "Virtual Parallelism" to deploy.

It is absolutely critical to note that it is proposed that such choices MUST
be **entirely transparent** to the end-user and the compiler.  Whilst
a Vector (varible-width SIM) may not precisely match the width of the
parallelism within the implementation, the end-user **should not care**
and in this way the performance benefits are gained but the ISA remains
straightforward.  All that happens at the end of an instruction run is: some
parallel units (if there are any) would remain offline, completely
transparently to the ISA, the program, and the compiler.

The "SIMD considered harmful" trap of having huge complexity and extra
instructions to deal with corner-cases is thus avoided, and implementors
get to choose precisely where to focus and target the benefits of their
implementation efforts, without "extra baggage".

# Example of vector / vector, vector / scalar, scalar / scalar => vector add

    register CSRvectorlen[XLEN][4]; # not quite decided yet about this one...
    register CSRpredicate[XLEN][4]; # 2^4 is max vector length
    register CSRreg_is_vectorised[XLEN]; # just for fun support scalars as well
    register x[32][XLEN];

    function op_add(rd, rs1, rs2, predr)
    {
       /* note that this is ADD, not PADD */
       int i, id, irs1, irs2;
       # checks CSRvectorlen[rd] == CSRvectorlen[rs] etc. ignored
       # also destination makes no sense as a scalar but what the hell...
       for (i = 0, id=0, irs1=0, irs2=0; i<CSRvectorlen[rd]; i++)

             irs1 += 1;
          if (CSRreg_is_vectorised[rs2]) # bitfield check rs2, scalar/vector?
             irs2 += 1;
    }

# V-Extension to Simple-V Comparative Analysis

This section covers the ways in which Simple-V is comparable
to, or more flexible than, V-Extension (V2.3-draft).  Also covered is
one major weak-point (register files are fixed size, where V is
arbitrary length), and how best to deal with that, should V be adapted
to be on top of Simple-V.

The first stages of this section go over each of the sections of V2.3-draft V
where appropriate

## 17.3 Shape Encoding

Simple-V's proposed means of expressing whether a register (from the
standard integer or the standard floating-point file) is a scalar or
a vector is to simply set the vector length to 1.  The instruction
would however have to specify which register file (integer or FP) that
the vector-length was to be applied to.

Extended shapes (2-D etc) would not be part of Simple-V at all.

## 17.4 Representation Encoding

Simple-V would not have representation-encoding.  This is part of
polymorphism, which is considered too complex to implement (TODO: confirm?)

## 17.5 Element Bitwidth

This is directly equivalent to Simple-V's "Packed", and implies that
integer (or floating-point) are divided down into vector-indexable
chunks of size Bitwidth.

In this way it becomes possible to have ADD effectively and implicitly
turn into ADDb (8-bit add), ADDw (16-bit add) and so on, and where
vector-length has been set to greater than 1, it becomes a "Packed"
(SIMD) instruction.

It remains to be decided what should be done when RV32 / RV64 ADD (sized)
opcodes are used.  One useful idea would be, on an RV64 system where
a 32-bit-sized ADD was performed, to simply use the least significant
32-bits of the register (exactly as is currently done) but at the same
time to *respect the packed bitwidth as well*.

The extended encoding (Table 17.6) would not be part of Simple-V.

## 17.6 Base Vector Extension Supported Types

TODO: analyse.  probably exactly the same.

## 17.7 Maximum Vector Element Width

No equivalent in Simple-V

## 17.8 Vector Configuration Registers

TODO: analyse.

## 17.9 Legal Vector Unit Configurations

TODO: analyse

## 17.10 Vector Unit CSRs

## 17.11 Maximum Vector Length (MVL)

Basically implicitly this is set to the maximum size of the register
file multiplied by the number of 8-bit packed ints that can fit into
a register (4 for RV32, 8 for RV64 and 16 for RV128).

## !7.12 Vector Instruction Formats

No equivalent in Simple-V because *all* instructions of *all* Extensions
are implicitly parallelised (and packed).

## 17.13 Polymorphic Vector Instructions

Polymorphism (implicit type-casting) is deliberately not supported
in Simple-V.

## 17.14 Rapid Configuration Instructions

TODO: analyse if this is useful to have an equivalent in Simple-V

## 17.15 Vector-Type-Change Instructions

TODO: analyse if this is useful to have an equivalent in Simple-V

## 17.16 Vector Length

Has a direct corresponding equivalent.

## 17.17 Predicated Execution

Predicated Execution is another name for "masking" or "tagging".  Masked
(or tagged) implies that there is a bit field which is indexed, and each
bit associated with the corresponding indexed offset register within
the "Vector".  If the tag / mask bit is 1, when a parallel operation is
issued, the indexed element of the vector has the operation carried out.
However if the tag / mask bit is *zero*, that particular indexed element
of the vector does *not* have the requested operation carried out.

In V2.3-draft V, there is a significant (not recommended) difference:
the zero-tagged elements are *set to zero*.  This loses a *significant*
advantage of mask / tagging, particularly if the entire mask register
is itself a general-purpose register, as that general-purpose register
can be inverted, shifted, and'ed, or'ed and so on.  In other words
it becomes possible, especially if Carry/Overflow from each vector
operation is also accessible, to do conditional (step-by-step) vector
operations including things like turn vectors into 1024-bit or greater
operands with very few instructions, by treating the "carry" from
one instruction as a way to do "Conditional add of 1 to the register
next door".  If V2.3-draft V sets zero-tagged elements to zero, such
extremely powerful techniques are simply not possible.

It is noted that there is no mention of an equivalent to BEXT (element
skipping) which would be particularly fascinating and powerful to have.
In this mode, the "mask" would skip elements where its mask bit was zero
in either the source or the destination operand.

Lots to be discussed.

## 17.18 Vector Load/Store Instructions

The Vector Load/Store instructions as proposed in V are extremely powerful
and can be used for reordering and regular restructuring.

Vector Load:

    if (unit-strided) stride = elsize;
    else stride = areg[as2]; // constant-strided
    for (int i=0; i<vl; ++i)
      if ([!]preg[p][i])
        for (int j=0; j<seglen+1; j++)
          vreg[vd+j][i] = mem[areg[as1] + (i*(seglen+1)+j)*stride];

Store:

    if (unit-strided) stride = elsize;
    else stride = areg[as2]; // constant-strided
    for (int i=0; i<vl; ++i)
      if ([!]preg[p][i])
        for (int j=0; j<seglen+1; j++)
          mem[areg[base] + (i*(seglen+1)+j)*stride] = vreg[vd+j][i];

Indexed Load:

    for (int i=0; i<vl; ++i)
      if ([!]preg[p][i])
        for (int j=0; j<seglen+1; j++)
          vreg[vd+j][i] = mem[sreg[base] + vreg[vs2][i] + j*elsize];

Indexed Store:

    for (int i=0; i<vl; ++i)
    if ([!]preg[p][i])
      for (int j=0; j<seglen+1; j++)
        mem[sreg[base] + vreg[vs2][i] + j*elsize] = vreg[vd+j][i];

Keeping these instructions as-is for Simple-V is highly recommended.
However: one of the goals of this Extension is to retro-fit (re-use)
existing RV Load/Store:

## 17.19 Vector Register Gather

TODO

## TODO, sort

> However, there are also several features that go beyond simply attaching VL
> to a scalar operation and are crucial to being able to vectorize a lot of
> code.  To name a few:
> - Conditional execution (i.e., predicated operations)
> - Inter-lane data movement (e.g. SLIDE, SELECT)
> - Reductions (e.g., VADD with a scalar destination)

 Ok so the Conditional and also the Reductions is one of the reasons
 why as part of SimpleV / variable-SIMD / parallelism (gah gotta think
 of a decent name) i proposed that it be implemented as "if you say r0
 is to be a vector / SIMD that means operations actually take place on
 r0,r1,r2... r(N-1)".

 Consequently any parallel operation could be paused (or... more
 specifically: vectors disabled by resetting it back to a default /
 scalar / vector-length=1) yet the results would actually be in the
 *main register file* (integer or float) and so anything that wasn't
 possible to easily do in "simple" parallel terms could be done *out*
 of parallel "mode" instead.

 I do appreciate that the above does imply that there is a limit to the
 length that SimpleV (whatever) can be parallelised, namely that you
 run out of registers!  my thought there was, "leave space for the main
 V-Ext proposal to extend it to the length that V currently supports".
 Honestly i had not thought through precisely how that would work.

 Inter-lane (SELECT) i saw 17.19 in V2.3-Draft p117, I liked that,
 it reminds me of the discussion with Clifford on bit-manipulation
 (gather-scatter except not Bit Gather Scatter, *data* gather scatter): if
 applied "globally and outside of V and P" SLIDE and SELECT might become
 an extremely powerful way to do fast memory copy and reordering [2[.

 However I haven't quite got my head round how that would work: i am
 used to the concept of register "tags" (the modern term is "masks")
 and i *think* if "masks" were applied to a Simple-V-enhanced LOAD /
 STORE you would get the exact same thing as SELECT.

 SLIDE you could do simply by setting say r0 vector-length to say 16
 (meaning that if referred to in any operation it would be an implicit
 parallel operation on *all* registers r0 through r15), and temporarily
 set say.... r7 vector-length to say... 5.  Do a LOAD on r7 and it would
 implicitly mean "load from memory into r7 through r11".  Then you go
 back and do an operation on r0 and ta-daa, you're actually doing an
 operation on a SLID {SLIDED?) vector.

 The advantage of Simple-V (whatever) over V would be that you could
 actually do *operations* in the middle of vectors (not just SLIDEs)
 simply by (as above) setting r0 vector-length to 16 and r7 vector-length
 to 5.  There would be nothing preventing you from doing an ADD on r0
 (which meant do an ADD on r0 through r15) followed *immediately in the
 next instruction with no setup cost* a MUL on r7 (which actually meant
 "do a parallel MUL on r7 through r11").

 btw it's worth mentioning that you'd get scalar-vector and vector-scalar
 implicitly by having one of the source register be vector-length 1
 (the default) and one being N > 1.  but without having special opcodes
 to do it.  i *believe* (or more like "logically infer or deduce" as
 i haven't got access to the spec) that that would result in a further
 opcode reduction when comparing [draft] V-Ext to [proposed] Simple-V.

 Also, Reduction *might* be possible by specifying that the destination be
 a scalar (vector-length=1) whilst the source be a vector.  However... it
 would be an awful lot of work to go through *every single instruction*
 in *every* Extension, working out which ones could be parallelised (ADD,
 MUL, XOR) and those that definitely could not (DIV, SUB).  Is that worth
 the effort?  maybe.  Would it result in huge complexity? probably.
 Could an implementor just go "I ain't doing *that* as parallel!
 let's make it virtual-parallelism (sequential reduction) instead"?
 absolutely.  So, now that I think it through, Simple-V (whatever)
 covers Reduction as well.  huh, that's a surprise.

 Now that _is_ an interesting concept.  A little scary, i imagine, with
 the possibility of putting a processor into a hard infinite execution
 loop... :)

 yes.  i love that aspect of V, i am a huge fan of polymorphism [1]
 which is why i am keen to advocate that the same runtime principle be
 extended to the rest of the RISC-V ISA [3]

 Yikes that's a lot.  I'm going to need to pull this into the wiki to
 make sure it's not lost.

[1] inherent data type conversion: 25 years ago i designed a hypothetical
hyper-hyper-hyper-escape-code-sequencing ISA based around 2-bit
(escape-extended) opcodes and 2-bit (escape-extended) operands that
only required a fixed 8-bit instruction length.  that relied heavily
on polymorphism and runtime size configurations as well.  At the time
I thought it would have meant one HELL of a lot of CSRs... but then I
met RISC-V and was cured instantly of that delusion^Wmisapprehension :)

[2] Interestingly if you then also add in the other aspect of Simple-V
(the data-size, which is effectively functionally orthogonal / identical
to "Packed" of Packed-SIMD), masked and packed *and* vectored LOAD / STORE
operations become byte / half-word / word augmenters of B-Ext's proposed
"BGS" i.e. where B-Ext's BGS dealt with bits, masked-packed-vectored
LOAD / STORE would deal with 8 / 16 / 32 bits at a time.  Where it
would get really REALLY interesting would be masked-packed-vectored
B-Ext BGS instructions.  I can't even get my head fully round that,
which is a good sign that the combination would be *really* powerful :)

[3] ok sadly maybe not the polymorphism, it's too complicated and I
think would be much too hard for implementors to easily "slide in" to an
existing non-Simple-V implementation.  i say that despite really *really*
wanting IEEE 704 FP Half-precision to end up somewhere in RISC-V in some
fashion, for optimising 3D Graphics.  *sigh*.

## TODO: analyse, auto-increment on unit-stride and constant-stride

so i thought about that for a day or so, and wondered if it would be
possible to propose a variant of zero-overhead loop that included
auto-incrementing the two address registers a2 and a3, as well as
providing a means to interact between the zero-overhead loop and the
vsetvl instruction.  a sort-of pseudo-assembly of that would look like:

    # a2 to be auto-incremented by t0 times 4
    zero-overhead-set-auto-increment a2, t0, 4
    # a2 to be auto-incremented by t0 times 4
    zero-overhead-set-auto-increment a3, t0, 4
    zero-overhead-set-loop-terminator-condition a0 zero
    zero-overhead-set-start-end stripmine, stripmine+endoffset
    stripmine:
    vsetvl t0,a0
    vlw v0, a2
    vlw v1, a3
    vfma v1, a1, v0, v1
    vsw v1, a3
    sub a0, a0, t0
    stripmine+endoffset:

the question is: would something like this even be desirable?  it's a
variant of auto-increment [1].  last time i saw any hint of auto-increment
register opcodes was in the 1980s... 68000 if i recall correctly... yep
see [1]

[1] http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e85_old/lectures/instruction/node6.html

Reply:

Another option for auto-increment is for vector-memory-access instructions
to support post-increment addressing for unit-stride and constant-stride
modes.  This can be implemented by the scalar unit passing the operation
to the vector unit while itself executing an appropriate multiply-and-add
to produce the incremented address.  This does *not* require additional
ports on the scalar register file, unlike scalar post-increment addressing
modes.

## TODO: instructions (based on Hwacha) V-Ext duplication analysis

This is partly speculative due to lack of access to an up-to-date
V-Ext Spec (V2.3-draft RVV 0.4-Draft at the time of writing).  However
basin an analysis instead on Hwacha, a cursory examination shows over
an **85%** duplication of V-Ext operand-related instructions when
compared to Simple-V on a standard RG64G base.   Even Vector Fetch
is analogous to "zero-overhead loop".

Exceptions are:

* Vector Indexed Memory Instructions (non-contiguous)
* Vector Atomic Memory Instructions.
* Some of the Vector Misc ops: VEIDX, VFIRST, VCLASS, VPOPC
  and potentially more.
* Consensual Jump

 not quite.  The zero-overhead loop unit interestingly would be at
an [independent] level above vector-length.  The distinctions are
as follows:

* Vector-length issues *virtual* instructions where the register
  operands are *specifically* altered (to cover a range of registers),
  whereas zero-overhead loops *specifically* do *NOT* alter the operands
  in *ANY* way.

* Vector-length-driven "virtual" instructions are driven by *one*
 and *only* one instruction (whether it be a LOAD, STORE, or pure
 one/two/three-operand opcode) whereas zero-overhead loop units
 specifically apply to *multiple* instructions.

Where vector-length-driven "virtual" instructions might get conceptually
blurred with zero-overhead loops is LOAD / STORE.  In the case of LOAD /
STORE, to actually be useful, vector-length-driven LOAD / STORE should
increment the LOAD / STORE memory address to correspondingly match the
increment in the register bank.  example:

* set vector-length for r0 to 4
* issue RV32 LOAD from addr 0x1230 to r0

translates effectively to:

* RV32 LOAD from addr 0x1230 to r0
* ...
* ...
* RV32 LOAD from addr 0x123B to r3

# Analysis of CSR decoding on latency <a name="csr_decoding_analysis"></a>

It could indeed have been logically deduced (or expected), that there
would be additional decode latency in this proposal, because if
overloading the opcodes to have different meanings, there is guaranteed
to be some state, some-where, directly related to registers.

There are several cases:

* All operands vector-length=1 (scalars), all operands
  packed-bitwidth="default": instructions are passed through direct as if
  Simple-V did not exist.  Simple-V is, in effect, completely disabled.
* At least one operand vector-length > 1, all operands
  packed-bitwidth="default": any parallel vector ALUs placed on "alert",
  virtual parallelism looping may be activated.
* All operands vector-length=1 (scalars), at least one
  operand packed-bitwidth != default: degenerate case of SIMD,
  implementation-specific complexity here (packed decode before ALUs or
  *IN* ALUs)
* At least one operand vector-length > 1, at least one operand
  packed-bitwidth != default: parallel vector ALUs (if any)
  placed on "alert", virtual parallelsim looping may be activated,
  implementation-specific SIMD complexity kicks in (packed decode before
  ALUs or *IN* ALUs).

Bear in mind that the proposal includes that the decision whether
to parallelise in hardware or whether to virtual-parallelise (to
dramatically simplify compilers and also not to run into the SIMD
instruction proliferation nightmare) *or* a transprent combination
of both, be done on a *per-operand basis*, so that implementors can
specifically choose to create an application-optimised implementation
that they believe (or know) will sell extremely well, without having
"Extra Standards-Mandated Baggage" that would otherwise blow their area
or power budget completely out the window.

Additionally, two possible CSR schemes have been proposed, in order to
greatly reduce CSR space:

* per-register CSRs (vector-length and packed-bitwidth)
* a smaller number of CSRs with the same information but with an *INDEX*
  specifying WHICH register in one of three regfiles (vector, fp, int)
  the length and bitwidth applies to.

(See "CSR vector-length and CSR SIMD packed-bitwidth" section for details)

In addition, LOAD/STORE has its own associated proposed CSRs that
mirror the STRIDE (but not yet STRIDE-SEGMENT?) functionality of
V (and Hwacha).

Also bear in mind that, for reasons of simplicity for implementors,
I was coming round to the idea of permitting implementors to choose
exactly which bitwidths they would like to support in hardware and which
to allow to fall through to software-trap emulation.

So the question boils down to:

* whether either (or both) of those two CSR schemes have significant
  latency that could even potentially require an extra pipeline decode stage
* whether there are implementations that can be thought of which do *not*
  introduce significant latency
* whether it is possible to explicitly (through quite simply
  disabling Simple-V-Ext) or implicitly (detect the case all-vlens=1,
  all-simd-bitwidths=default) switch OFF any decoding, perhaps even to
  the extreme of skipping an entire pipeline stage (if one is needed)
* whether packed bitwidth and associated regfile splitting is so complex
  that it should definitely, definitely be made mandatory that implementors
  move regfile splitting into the ALU, and what are the implications of that
* whether even if that *is* made mandatory, is software-trapped
  "unsupported bitwidths" still desirable, on the basis that SIMD is such
  a complete nightmare that *even* having a software implementation is
  better, making Simple-V have more in common with a software API than
  anything else.

Whilst the above may seem to be severe minuses, there are some strong
pluses:

* Significant reduction of V's opcode space: over 85%.
* Smaller reduction of P's opcode space: around 10%.
* The potential to use Compressed instructions in both Vector and SIMD
  due to the overloading of register meaning (implicit vectorisation,
  implicit packing)
* Not only present but also future extensions automatically gain parallelism.
* Already mentioned but worth emphasising: the simplification to compiler
  writers and assembly-level writers of having the same consistent ISA
  regardless of whether the internal level of parallelism (number of
  parallel ALUs) is only equal to one ("virtual" parallelism), or is
  greater than one, should not be underestimated.
