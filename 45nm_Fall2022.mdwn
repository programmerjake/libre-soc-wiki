# Specs for 2022 SOC

## Applications

 - We are providing open source drivers for the GPU,
hopefully completed by Fall 2022.
 - Given that POWER CPUs do not have GPUs, RaptorCS
would like the LibreSOC to be able function as a
GPU in PCIE slave mode.
 - Lastly, RaptorCS would like to manufacture single
board computers.

## Devices
 - 4 Core POWER CPU
 - SimpleV GPU
 - PCIE Slave controller(RaptorCS also wants to use LibreSOC as a GPU on their POWER mobos)
 - IOMMU
 - Coherent Accelerator Processor Proxy (CAPP) functional unit
 - PCIE host Controller

## Interfaces

### Advanced

 - SERDES - 10rx, 14tx
   - 4tx, 4rx for [OMI(DDR4](https://openpowerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jeff-Steuchli.OpenCAPI-OPS-OMI.pdf) on top of SERDES with OpenCAPI protocol) @5GHz
   - 2tx, 2rx for ethernet
   - 4tx, 4rx for PCIE and other CAPI devices
   - 3tx for HDMI
 - [OpenFSI](https://openpowerfoundation.org/?resource_lib=field-replaceable-unit-fru-service-interface-fsi-openfsi-specification) instead of JTAG
   - [Raptor HDL](https://gitlab.raptorengineering.com/raptor-engineering-public/lpc-spi-bridge-fpga)
   - [Raptor Libsigrok](https://gitlab.raptorengineering.com/raptor-engineering-public/dsview/-/tree/master/libsigrokdecode4DSL/decoders/fsi)
 - USB 2.0 - [Luna USB](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/luna)
with [USB3300 PHY](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/USB3300#datasheet-toggle) (Tested max at 333MB/s with Luna on ECP5)

### Basic

These should be easily doable with LiteX.

* [[shakti/m_class/UART]]
* [[shakti/m_class/I2C]]
* [[shakti/m_class/GPIO]]
* [[shakti/m_class/SPI]]
* [[shakti/m_class/QSPI]]
* [[shakti/m_class/LPC]]
* [[shakti/m_class/EINT]]

## Protocols
 - IPMT over i2c to talk to the BMC
