# 180 nm ASIC plan for Oct 2020

This page is for discussion of what we can aim for and reasonably achieve.
To be expanded with links to bugreports

## Minimum viability

* a Wishbone interface. Â this allows us to drop *directly* into
  already-written Litex "SOC" infrastructure (leaving all of us free to
  focus on the essentials)
* the dependency matrices are essential.
* a Branch Function Unit is essential (minimum of 1)
* Load/Store Function Units are essential
* so are multiple register file files (SPRs, Condition Regs, 32x INT Regs)
* the integer pipelines (integer and logic instructions) are essential
  (the FP ones not so much)
* a very very basic Branch Prediction system (fixed, but observing POWER
  branch "hints")
* a very very basic Common Data Bus infrastructure.
* a TLB and MMU are not strictly essential (not for a proof-of-concept ASIC)
* neither in some ways is a L1 cache
* interfaces we need as a bare minimum include GPIO, EINT, SPI and QSPI,
  I2C, UART16550, LPC (from Raptor Engineering) and that actually might
  even be it.

## Secondary priorities

* a PLL (this is quite a lot however it turns the ASIC from a 24mhz
  design into a 300mhz design)
* a TLB and MMU (in combination with a PLL if it is GNU/Linux OS capable
  we have an actual viable *saleable product*, immediately)
* dual L1 Caches with the 2x 128-bit-wide L0CacheBuffer to merge 8x LD/STs
* multiple Common Data Buses to / from the RegFile along with a 4x
  "Striped" HI/LO-32-ODD/EVEN access pattern.
* multi-issue
* PartitionedSignal-based integer pipelines
* an FP regfile and associated FP pipelines
* SV compliance
* 128x INT/FP registers
* GPU-style opcodes - Jacob mentioned Texturisation opcodes as being
  more important than e.g. SIN/COS.
* additional interfaces such as RGB/TTL, SDRAM, HyperRAM, RGMII, SD/MMC,
  USB-ULPI
* a pinmux
