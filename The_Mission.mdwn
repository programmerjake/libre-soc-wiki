## The Mission

 - give mass volume appliance manufacturers an alternative to expensive un-auditable chips.
 - maximize the degree of trust a customer can place in their processor. 

## The Means:

- provide the customer the **freedom to study, modify, and redistribute** the full SoC source from HDL and boot loader to down to the VLSI.
- engage in **full transparency** at every level of the development, right from the inception through to delivery of silicon.  no exceptions.

## The Market:

 - chromebooks
 - smartphones
 - tablets
 - industrial boards
 - single-board computers (like the Raspberry Pi)
 - whatever you want

## The Machine:

- our first target (Oct 2020): a single-core dual-issue 180nm 64-bit "demo" QFP chip that will also be a saleable product in the "Embedded" space (Arduino, STM32F, Ingenic jz4720).
- a full quad core SoC: 800mhz, dual issue, 4-wide FP32, Hybrid CPU / GPU / VPU [and later an ML inference core], comparable to the Allwinner 64 in capability.
