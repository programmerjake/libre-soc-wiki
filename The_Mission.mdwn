# The Mission

- to give mass volume appliance manufacturers an alternative to expensive
   un-auditable chips.
- to maximize the degree of trust a customer (business or user) can place in
  their processor.
- to provide a libre, secure and transparently developed hybrid CPU VPU
  GPU architecture to the world.
- to provide businesses and users worldwide with an alternative to
  current proprietary opaque chipsets and drivers.

To accomplish this we:

- use collaborative techniques
- operate entirely transparently
- invite developers and experts around the world to contribute without NDAs
- invite inventors to contribute relevant patents to patent pools (OIN)

# The Means:

- provide the customer the **freedom to study, modify, and redistribute**
  the full SoC source from HDL and boot loader to down to the VLSI.
- engage in **full transparency** at every level of the development,
  right from the inception through to delivery of silicon.  no exceptions.
- listen to **constructive input** from world-leading industry experts,
  engineers and enthusiasts alike, in real-time, without NDAs creating
  artificial barriers to communication and hampering success.

# The Market:

 - chromebooks
 - smartphones
 - tablets
 - industrial boards
 - single-board computers (like the Raspberry Pi)
 - wearables
 - CV capable flight controller for lightweight drones
 - whatever you want

# The Machines:

- our first target (Oct 2020): a single-core dual-issue 180nm 64-bit
  "demo" QFP chip that will also be a saleable product in the "Embedded"
  space (Arduino, STM32F, Ingenic jz4720).
- a full quad core SoC: 800mhz, dual issue, 4-wide FP32, Hybrid CPU /
  GPU / VPU [and later an ML inference core], comparable to the Allwinner
  64 in capability.
- Products based on customer - and client - driven needs and requirements
