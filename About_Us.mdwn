## We want to:

 - give mass volume appliance manufacturers an alternative to expensive un-auditable chips.
 - maximize the degree of trust a customer can place in their processor. 

## We do this by:

 providing the customer the **freedom to study, modify, and redistribute** the full SoC source from HDL and boot loader to down to the VLSI.

## We're targeting:

 - chromebooks
 - smartphones
 - tablets
 - and industrial boards 

## We're Delivering:

a (quad core, 800mhz, dual issue, GPU, VPU, [and later an ML inference core] ) SOC.
