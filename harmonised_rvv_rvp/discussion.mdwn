## enabling/disabling individual 8 and 16-bit operations in SIMD blocks

* At the end of a loop, how are the three end operations of 4-wide 8-bit operations to be disabled (to avoid "SIMD considered harmful"?)
* Likewise at the beginning of a loop, how are (up to) the first three operations to be disabled?
* Likewise the last (and first) of 2-wide 16-bit operations?
* What about predication within a 4-wide 8-bit group?
* Likewise what about predication within a 2-wide 16-bit group?
