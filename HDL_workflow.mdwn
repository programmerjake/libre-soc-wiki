# HDL workflow

This section describes the workflow for developing the LibreSoC.

# Hardware

RAM is the biggest requirement. Minimum 16GB, the more the better.  Disk space is not hugely critical: 256GB SSD should be more than adequate.  Simulations however are where raw processing power is a must.  High end Graphics Cards are nonessential.

# Operating System

First install Debian (ubuntu if you absolutely must) for standardisation cross-team and so that toochain installation is greatly simplified.

A basic GUI desktop is necessary: fvwm2, xfce, lxde are perfectly sufficient (alongside wicd-gtk for network management). Other more complex desktops can be used however may consume greater resources.

# Software prerequisites

* apt-get install build-essential
* apt-get install git python3.7
