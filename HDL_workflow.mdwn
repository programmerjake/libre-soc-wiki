# HDL workflow

This section describes the workflow for developing the LibreSoC.

# Hardware

RAM is the biggest requirement. Minimum 16GB, the more the better.  Disk space is not hugely critical: 256GB SSD should be more than adequate.  Simulations however are where raw processing power is a must.  High end Graphics Cards are nonessential.

# Operating System

First install Debian (ubuntu if you absolutely must) for standardisation cross-team and so that toochain installation is greatly simplified.

A basic GUI desktop is necessary: fvwm2, xfce, lxde are perfectly sufficient (alongside wicd-gtk for network management). Other more complex desktops can be used however may consume greater resources.

# Software prerequisites

Whilst many resources advocate sudo in front of all of the root-level command below, this is extremely irritating. run "sudo bash", get a root prompt, and save some typing.

* # apt-get install build-essential
* # apt-get install git python3.7 python3.7-dev python-nosetest3
* # apt-get install graphviz xdot
* return to user prompt (ctrl-d)

## yosys

## nmigen

nmigen may be installed as follows:

* mkdir ~/src
* cd !$
* git clone https://github.com/m-labs/nmigen.git
* cd nmigen
* sudo bash
* python3 setup.py develop
* ctrl-d

testing can then be carried out with "python3 setp.py test"
