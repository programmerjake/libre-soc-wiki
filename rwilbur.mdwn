## Currently

Working on the following efforts:

* Multiplication

Working on the [[multiplication|/3d_gpu/architecture/dynamic_simd/mul]] wiki page to document ideas for multiplication algorithms and implementation.

* Bug 602

Working on [Bug 602 - low performance bare minimum functionality SIMD emulator required][bug 602] pulling pseudocode out of documentation to make a VSX implementation in software.  Based on the ISA spec. v3.0B:

1.  pp. 246 to 252, vector pack/unpack (Looks like section 6.8 "Vector Permute and Formatting Instructions", subsection 6.8.1 "Vector Pack and Unpack Instructions" actually appears on pages labeled 248-254 which are actually pages 266-272)
