## Original Instructions

See <https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=517#c0>

Checklist based on above

* For god's sake make sure you get this right, ***TRIPLE*** check everything.
    
* ***DO*** make sure to ***only*** drive an input as an input, and to ***only*** drive an output as an output.

* ***DO*** make sure to ***only*** wire up 3.3V to 3.3V and to ***only*** wire up GND to GND with the jumper-cables.

* ***DO*** make sure that ***before*** even ***thinking*** of uploading to and powering up the FPGA that everything has been ***THOROUGHLY*** triple-checked.

If you violate any of the above stated hard-and-fast rules you will end up learning the hard way by **DESTROYING** the FPGA.

To start we have to ensure we have a safe set up.

| Checklist Step |
|----------------|
| Ensure power is disconnected from FPGA |
| Ensure ft232r USB is disconnected |
| Ensure FPGA USB is disconnected |

Now lets review all of the relevant material on this page before we begin the wiring process.

| Checklist Step |
|----------------|
| Review the ft232r Connector diagram and table |
| Review the connections table for your model of fpga |
| Ensure the orientation of the FPGA and ft232r match that of the images and diagrams on this page |

Next we will wire up the ft232r and our FPGA in three separate stages. 

* First we will attach one end of a ***MALE-TO-MALE (MTM)*** jumper cable to each necessary female header pin-hole on the ft232f. 

* Then we will attach one end of a ***FEMALE-TO-FEMALE (FTF)*** cable to each male header pin on the FPGA.

* Finally, we will connect the wires from the ft232r to the wires from the FPGA by matching the colours of the wires.

This way you do not lose the connections when you want to disconnect and store the two devices. We are using FEMALE-TO-FEMALE jumper cables on the male header pins of the FPGA so that the wires do not randomly damage the bare PCB due to a short.

We will wire each of the pins on the the ft232r according to the diagrams, tables, and images on this page. 

|   Action   | Colour | Pin Name |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Attach MTM | Black  |   GND    |
| Attach MTM | Brown  |   TMS    |
| Attach MTM | Red    |   VCC    |
| Attach MTM | Orange |   TCK    |
| Attach MTM | Yellow |   TDI    |
| Attach MTM | Green  |   TDO    |

Next, we will wire each of the pins on the the FPGA according to the diagrams, tables, and images on this page.

Follow this section if you have the ULX3S FPGA:

|   Action   | Colour | Pin # | Pin Name |
|------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Attach FTF | Red    |   2   |   VREF   |
| Attach FTF | Black  |   4   |   GND    |
| Attach FTF | Yellow |   5   |   TDI    |
| Attach FTF | Brown  |   6   |   TMS    |
| Attach FTF | Orange |   7   |   TCK    |
| Attach FTF | Green  |   8   |   TDO    |

Follow this section if you have the Versa ECP5 FPGA:

|   Action   | Colour | X3 Pin # | Pin Name |
|------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Attach FTF | Red    |    39    |   VREF   |
| Attach FTF | Black  |     1    |   GND    |
| Attach FTF | Yellow |     4    |   TDI    |
| Attach FTF | Brown  |     5    |   TMS    |
| Attach FTF | Orange |     6    |   TCK    |
| Attach FTF | Green  |     7    |   TDO    |

Final steps for both FPGA boards:

| Checklist Step |
|----------------|
| Check each jumper wire connection between the corresponding pins on the FPGA and the ft232r **THREE** times |
| ***lckl*** check for ground loops? |


Finally, we will connect the jumper cables of the same colour from ft232r and the FPGA.

| Checklist Step |
|----------------|
| Attach the ends of the **RED** jumper cables    |
| Attach the ends of the **BLACK** jumper cables  |
| Attach the ends of the **YELLOW** jumper cables |
| Attach the ends of the **BROWN** jumper cables  |
| Attach the ends of the **ORANGE** jumper cables |
| Attach the ends of the **GREEN** jumper cables  |

***lckl if both the micro-usb cable and the ft232r GND and VCC wires are connected to the fpga will this result in volatage fighting where the fpga will be damaged?***

Finally, plug in the USB end of the USB-to-MicroUSB cable that is plugged into the ft232r into your computer. Begin testing the SOC on the FPGA (instructions to follow).

As noted in the schematic pins GP,GN 0-7 are single ended non-differential pairs, whereas pins GP,GN 8-13 I haven't mapped out here as they are bidirectional differential pairs.
