# git checklist

When using git this is a reminder of commands to run and best practices  
If you are very new to git, you would want to read [a really quick intro to git](/HDL_workflow/git_intro) first.

## what to do if you want to modify some pages

Here is the checklist for making changes.

[[!template id=note text="""If you do not intend to complete
the work right the way through to "git push" immediately (at least by the end
of the day), or do not "have time", reconsider and find a way to make the work
smaller. If unsure, ask on the mailing list."""]]

* run `git pull`
* edit files, making sure only one â€œpurpose"
* save them
* run unit tests and make sure they pass
* fix errors
* run `git status | more`, review the output
* run `git diff`, review the output
* run `git commit -a -m 'useful description' `
* run `git pull`
* run `git push`

# what to do if "git pull" results in conflict

# what to do if you want to add files.

this one, `git status` is very important, to check files that should have
been added but have not.
