# git checklist

when using git this is a reminder of commands to run and best practices

## How does working with git looks like
* You download a directory with project files in it
* Modify some files, add others
* Upload your work so other can take advantage of it

In git you do this by:

* *Cloning* a repository (aka downloading stuff)
* *Committing* your local changes (aka you "take note" of what you did. e.g. modified some files, added new files, deleted some files and so on)
* *Pushing* your work online (aka uploading online)

## Cloning
(optional) `cd ` + somewhere in your disk  
`git clone ` + repo url

## Making changes
*// You know what to do*

## Committing
`git add` + files you want to "take note" of.

E.g. `git add test.png` will take note of the “test.png" file for when you will want to commit your work. (Committing your work is like saving in a videogame. When you are good with what you have done, you save the stage of the adventure).

When committing you are required to add a comment to your "save file" (commit).  
Like ~~"I added the test.png file"~~.  
Ahah, I was kidding. Remember:  
> the git message is for WHY you did what you did.
> 
> not what ACTION was done on what file.

## Pushing
When you are done committing all your stuff, you want to share it with other. So you push on the remote repository (directory).

So you just `git push`.


### Notes 1
Pay attention to:

* what you modify in the repository 
* what files you add to your commit
* when pushing, what are you actually pushing

### Notes 2
When doing `git commit` best thing to do is to add ` -m "<comment here, without brackets>"`

Like this: `git commit -m "added test.png"`.

If you omit the -m option, a text editor will appear to let you insert a commit message. Sometimes is useful to let git open the editor. e.g. for long comments or comments with quotes in it.

If `vim` editor opens (you get stuck into something you do not know how to exit from), remember:

* type `i` to "insert text".
* when you are doing typing some text, press the esc key on the keyboard
* if you want to save the comment/text, press `w` (means "write")
* to quit, press `q`

You are done.  
To quit without saving/writing: `q!` (e.g. you want to exit)
