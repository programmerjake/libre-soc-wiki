# build process for ls180

for the variant without 4k srams:

    standard install (see [[HDL_workflow]]
    cd soc
    make ls180_verilog
    cd src/soc/litex/florent
    make ls180
    cp ls180.il /tmp

at this point you can copy ls180.il over to the coriolis2 chroot,
into soclayout experiments9:

    soclayout/experiments9/non_generated/full_core_ls180.il 

and you can then begin the build process inside the coriolis2 chroot:

    cd soclayout/experiments9
    nohup ./build_ls180.sh &
