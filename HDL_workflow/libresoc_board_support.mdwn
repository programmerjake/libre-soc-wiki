# TODO

Hardware (HDL) to be supported:

* Microwatt and Libre-SOC (using same HDL interface)
* Microwatt XICS Interrupt Controller (currently already upstream in linux 5.7)
* OpenCores UART16550 Serial port
* Tercel Quad-SPI "XIP" (execute-in-place) from Raptor Engineering
* OpenCores 10/100 Ethernet MAC
* Jean Thomas "GRAM" DDR3 PHY/Controller

HDL "peripheral fabric":

* <https://git.libre-soc.org/?p=ls2.git;a=summary>

Recommended FPGA Boards:

* VERSA_ECP5 (if possible - it is barely achievable due to only 45k LUT4s)
* OrangeCrab r0.2 85k **not the 25k it is inadequate**
* Raptor Engineering ModBMC
* Digilent Arty A7 (under test, requires nextpnr-xilinx which is very very slow)

None of these are ideal... yet.  WIP.
