## Requirements

Instructions assumed to be called in a schroot environment.

1. Call nextpcr-ecp5-install
1. Add environment vars for libtrellis and nextpnr-ecp5 (otherwise building with nmigen-boards will fail).
    export PATH=/usr/local/libtrellis/bin:/usr/local/nextpnr-ecp5/bin:/usr/lib/ccache:"$PATH"
1. apt install dfu-util
1. Add a udev rule for the orangecrab in /etc/udev/rules.d/ . The rule was taken from <https://github.com/orangecrab-fpga/orangecrab-hardware/blob/main/contrib/10-orangecrab.rules>.
    ATTRS{idVendor}=="1209", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5af0", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev", TAG+="uaccess"
1. Git clone "nmigen-boards" from gitlab <https://gitlab.com/nmigen/nmigen-boards>
1. cd into "nmigen-boards" and install by calling:
    python3 setup.py develop

## Setting orangecrab into DFU

1. Press and hold the button on the orangecrab.
1. Plug in the usb cable.
1. Calling the following should show two devices: one is the RISCV firmware bootloader, the other is the user bitstream.

## Build and upload "blinky"
1. cd into "nmigen-boards/nmigen-boards".
1. Build and program the board: 
    python3 -m nmigen_boards.orangecrab_r0_2
1. You should now have a *very* bright LED flashing!
