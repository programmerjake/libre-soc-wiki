# Pinmux, IO Pads, and JTAG Boundary scan

Managing IO on an ASIC is nowhere near as simple as on an FPGA.
An FPGA has built-in IO Pads, the wires terminate inside an
existing silicon block which has been tested for you.

Designing an ASIC, there is no guarantee that the IO pad is
working when manufactured. Worse, the peripheral could be
faulty.  How can you tell what the cause is? There are two
possible faults, but only one symptom ("it dunt wurk").
This problem is what JTAG Boundary Scan is designed to solve.
JTAG can be operated
at very low clock frequencies (5 khz is perfectly acceptable)
so there is very little risk of clock skew during that testing.
