Minutes of Meeting

```
Date: August 6, Friday
Time: Started at 6:30 p.m. IST
Participants: Luke Leighton, David Calderhood and the Object Automation team

In the last call, Luke told everybody to go through the 6 steps
mentioned in “How can I help as a developer” listed in the
https://libre-soc.org/.

Arjun asked whether everyone had completed it.

Luke asked if anyone had any questions about the process. 

Aditya asked what kind of skill sets do we have to provide? Luke explained
skill sets such as verilog, circuit point design, gate-level design
experience. Free software projects and online repository for those. Do
you have any web site?, etc. and these have to be in brief.

On joining the mailing list, “libre-soc-dev” is the best one, Luke
asked to read the HDL workflow and become familiar with how to interact
with people on the mailing list.

Luke talked about etiquette on using mailing lists.

Object Automation email IDs will be used for correspondence.

Action Item:
Gmail e-mail IDs and Object Automation e-mail IDs were sent to Luke and David.

GitHub access will be provided after the employees agree to the
Libre-SoC’s 4 charter.

The charters are:
1) Always do good
2) Never do harm
3) Everyone knows the code.
4) The code applies 100% of the time.

Luke talked about the wiki page, bug tracker, email thread and
cross-reference.
.
Questions posted in the IRC log will be answered within 36 hours.

Configuration and specification of the computer:

1) Luke said 8 GB RAM is ok, but having 18GB RAM is better.
2) The larger the resolution screen is better.

Luke said he has access to 2 workstations with 24 cores, 72 threads and
128 GB RAM.  Once we agree to the charter, he will provide an SSH key
to that machine.

With a minimum of 8GB, one can do HTL simulations, run unit tests locally. 

Luke told everybody to read the HTL workflow documentation info. It has
important information on projects, interacting with other people and
other basic things.

No code is written without unitest.

Luke said they have dev and set up scripts.

Luke shared his 25 years of experience in managing free software projects
and collaborative project management.

Luke has these dev and setup scripts, which allow you to automatically
install Operating System dependencies and softwares.  Luke said installing
Ubuntu is sufficient.

Whenever a task is completed, commit and push have to be done immediately.
He also said we are paid for completion of tasks not by time.

He said do not commit if you have not run the test.

Some of the work available:
1) Adding a few signals to wishbone. Budget is 2500 euros. Bug 244
2) Reference implementation in verilog. Budget is 1350 euros. Bug 246

Arjun asked any documentation is available Luke said if something is
missing, we would like to document and put it on wiki.  .  Wiki is a
git repository. You will be able to  git clone the entire contents of
the markdown files containing wiki documentation. You will be able to
do local search on local computers.

Bug 175 is the critical one to start.

Luke talked about the dev setup scripts, which are used to clone
multiple repositories. To do the above, we can use this URL:
https://libre-soc.org/HDL_workflow/devscripts/?updated.

There is also a walkthrough YouTube video available.

Arjun said the review will happen on Fridays.

Luke said Robert Baruch’s tutorial is the best one to learn nMigen.
