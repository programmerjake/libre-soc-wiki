Please be short and to the point in your answers; focus primarily on
the what and how, not so much on the why. Add longer descriptions as
attachments (see below). If English isn't your first language, don't
worry - our reviewers don't care about spelling errors, only about
great ideas. We apologise for the inconvenience of having to submit in
English. On the up side, you can be as technical as you need to be (but
you don't have to). Do stay concrete. Use plain text in your reply only,
if you need any HTML to make your point please include this as attachment.

## Abstract: Can you explain the whole project and its expected outcome(s).

LIP6's VLSI tools are one of the few user-operated toolchains for creating
ASIC layouts where the full source code is available for inspection.
This means that there is no opportunity for insertion of rogue hardware
into an ASIC made by LIP6 tools which could compromise user trust, either locally or for
internet use. Further: academic, public and free discussion are all
engendered and fostered where at present NDAs rife through the VLSI
Industry prevent and prohibit discussion and general improvements beneficial
to users.
