## Yehowshua Immanuel

* Experience in HDL projects, PCB design, and drivers
* Interests: Compilers, HDL Tooling, Signal Processing, Mathematics,
  Electromagnetics
* Website: [[https://yehowshuaimmanuel.com]]
* Github: [[https://github.com/BracketMaster]]
* Availability: 6hrs/wk

## Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton

* Hardware Experience: assembly-level programming, gate-level
  circuit design, PCB design, reverse-engineering, embedded systems
  design and programming, software engineering, standards development,
  libre project management and more.
* Ethical Technology Specialist.  Identifies socio-economic imbalances and
  works out if there's an ethical way in which technology can help.  If that
  technology doesn't exist, creates it.
* Interests: varied and including particle physics and poetry.
* website: [[http://lkcl.net]]
* github: doesn't have one (because github is a proprietary non-free service),
  runs his own git servers, manages projects (several), entirely in a libre
  fashion, including managing the server(s).
* Availability: full-time

## Jacob Lifshay

* FOSS Software Developer, Hardware Designer, Original Author of Kazan (one of our GPU drivers, also a software-rendered Vulkan implementation that works on most CPUs)
* Built a working RV32I CPU and VGA core that runs a 3D game in 3 weeks: https://github.com/programmerjake/rv32
* Built an algebraic numbers library: https://crates.io/crates/algebraics
* Built a (non-official) reference implementation of IEEE 754-2019 (binary floating-point): https://crates.io/crates/simple-soft-float
* Interests: Computer Graphics, Compilers, Simulation, Rust-lang, Anime, Astrophysics, Electronics, Computer Design, Chemistry, Nuclear Physics, Cellular Automatons, Video Game Software Engineering, High-performance Computing
* GitHub: https://github.com/programmerjake
* Availability: full-time

## Tobias Platen

* Copyleft Software Developer, Hardware Designer and Reverse Engineer
* Interests: varied and including speech synthesis and cosplay.
