# Questions and Comments

* We claim that our first product will be a GbE router featuring up to to USB *2* ports. The maximum bandwidth of USB2 is 480Mb/s whereas the maximum bandwidth of USB3 is 5Gb/s. Is this a typo? or is the plan to provide 0.96Gb/s total, 0.48Gb/s to each of the two USB ports?
