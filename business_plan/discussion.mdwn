# Questions and Comments

* Cole: We claim that our first product will be a GbE router featuring up to to USB *2* ports. The maximum bandwidth of USB2 is 480Mb/s whereas the maximum bandwidth of USB3 is 5Gb/s. Is this a typo? or is the plan to provide 0.96Gb/s total, 0.48Gb/s to each of the two USB ports?

lkcl: 5 gigabit ethernet ports. 2 USB2 ports. this is 7 ports.

Cole: Thanks for the clarification this makes sense. The edit you made to this description on the page is more clear than its previous form.
