Please be short and to the point in your answers; focus primarily on
the what and how, not so much on the why. Add longer descriptions as
attachments (see below). If English isn't your first language, don't
worry - our reviewers don't care about spelling errors, only about
great ideas. We apologise for the inconvenience of having to submit in
English. On the up side, you can be as technical as you need to be (but
you don't have to). Do stay concrete. Use plain text in your reply only,
if you need any HTML to make your point please include this as attachment.

## Abstract: Can you explain the whole project and its expected outcome(s).

TODO

# Have you been involved with projects or organisations relevant to this project before? And if so, can you tell us a bit about your contributions?

Luke Leighton is an ethical technology specialist who has a consistent
24-year track record of developing code in a real-time transparent
(fully libre) fashion, and in managing Software Libre teams.  He is the
lead developer on the Libre RISC-V SoC.

TODO

# Requested Amount

EUR 50,000.

# Explain what the requested budget will be used for?

Improve the Wishbone B4 Specification to add streaming capability,
similar to AXI4 Streams

# Does the project have other funding sources, both past and present?

no.

# Compare your own project with existing or historical efforts.

AXI4 but it is proprietary and patented.

## What are significant technical challenges you expect to solve during the project, if any?

TODO

## Describe the ecosystem of the project, and how you will engage with relevant actors and promote the outcomes?

As mentioned in the 2018 submission, the Libre RISC-V
SoC has a full set of resources for Libre Project Management and development:
mailing list, bugtracker, git repository and wiki - all listed here:
<https://libre-riscv.org/>

In addition, we have a Crowdsupply page
<https://www.crowdsupply.com/libre-risc-v/m-class> which provides a public
gateway, and heise.de, reddit, phoronix, slashdot and other locations have
all picked up the story.  The list is updated and maintained here:
