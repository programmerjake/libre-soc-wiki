# Libre-RISCV Charter Agreement

* Draft Status (v0)
* Last Edited: 22 Sep 2019

This document is based on the Titanian's "Code of Honour" and on
the Systemic Laws of Organisations, listed in "Invisible Dynamics".
Comments and [[discussion]] elaborates.

# The Code of Honour

* Always do "good"
* Never do "harm"
* The Code applies 100% of the time
* Everyone knows The Code

This Code is simple and short enough to memorise. "Good" is further defined
to mean "increasing Truth, Awareness, Love or Creativity for one or more people
including yourself" and "Harm" is defined as *reducing* any of those same
four qualities for *anyone*.

However, The Code on its own, due to its minimalist nature, can be hard to
apply when the chips are down, so we further augment it with the Systemic Laws,
listed below.

Just as with The Code, the Systemic Laws are not optional.

# The Systemic Laws of Organisations.

The Systemic Laws are based primarily on respect, recognition, responsibility,
and ownership of the same; on encouragement and allowing each contributor
to grow and be part of the group.

* Everyone belongs; every contributor (users included), is recognised both
  in their own right as well as for their achievements and their contributions.
* Reality is acknowledged and accepted.
* Everyone is respected and honoured, past and present.
* Length of service is respected alongside and in balance with their level of
  expertise.
* Everyone acknowledges and accepts their role and seniority, and in turn
  acknowledge and accept the role and seniority of others.
* The responsibility to those we serve, when we take on a role of
  responsibility and power, is acknowledged and accepted.
* Everyone is rewarded equitably for their contributions.
* Everyone is responsible - and accountable - for their actions; good and bad,
  "Guilt" and "Merit" belong with whoever earned them.

# Decision-making and new contributors

* All decision-making shall be unanimous, including changes to the goal
* Abstention is permitted.
* New contributors must agree to abide by this Charter prior to being
  involved in decisions
* Only after agreement may new contributors propose changes (which will require
  unanimous agreement to implement)
