#        1 Excellence


##            1.1 Objectives and ambition


Throughout this Grant Proposal, you will note that we are making
significant use of ideas from the early days of Computing.  Due to
the limitations of physical technology at that time, these ideas were
categorised into "technology that was beyond delivery".  Industry-standard
computing from then to today missed many of those opportunities and
has consequently ploughed narrow "technological ruts" in an incremental
fashion that has detrimentally impacted and constrained all world-wide
Computing end-users as a result.  Modern hardware technology performance
is now allowing us to revisit the best of the "Sea of ideas" from the
history of the past 60 years of computing.  Our Grant Application is
therefore based on firm, practical proven foundations, backed up by a
real-world customer requirement: Advanced high-accuracy GPS Sensor-Fusion,
to prove the core's capabilities and energy efficiency.


We have chosen to evolve core technology to develop a Next-Generation
Supercomputer-scale Microprocessor family based on an existing
2-decades-proven base (the Power ISA), with Advanced Cray-style Vectors,
providing energy-efficient advanced computational power by a unique
methodology not currently being achieved by any current general-purpose
computing device.  We have been working on this strategy for over three
years and our grant application is now evolutionary but was revolutionary.


Libre-SOC has, for over three years, been backed by EU Funding through
NLnet and now NGI POINTER, and at the core of our work we have been
developing a novel Draft Vector ISA Extension to the OpenPOWER ISA,
called SVP64.  https://libre-soc.org/openpower/sv/svp64/ and an enhanced
processor core architecture on which it will run.


As an aside we must acknowledge the research work of IBM labs who designed
and then Open-Licensed their Power ISA: the foundation on which we have
been building.  Standing on the shoulders of greatness is never a bad
place to start.


SVP64 contains features and capabilities never seen in any Instruction
Set Architecture (ISA) of the past sixty years.  With NLnet's help we have
TRL (3) implementations and simulations demonstrating a 75% reduction in
the program size of core algorithms for Video and Audio DSP Processing
(FFT, DCT, Matrix Multiply), and these still need optimized, which if
successfully expanded to general-purpose algorithms would result in huge
power savings if deployed in mass-volume end-user products.


Why we are leveraging the Power ISA as the fundamental basis instead of
"completely novel non-standard computing architecture" requires some
explanation, best illustrated by reference to other historic high
capability designs.  Aspex Microelectronics ASP was a 4096-wide SIMD
Array of 2-bit processors. It could be programmed at a rate of one
instruction per 5-10 days.  Elixent also had a similar 2D Grid Array of
4-bit processors.  Both were ultra-power-efficient (2 orders of magnitude
for certain specialist tasks) but were impossible to program even for the
best programming minds and required critical assistance from a severely
limited pool of specialists for best exploitation. The Industry-standard
rate for general-purpose High-Level programming (C, C++) is around 150
lines of code per day, not 5-10 days per line of assembler. We seek to
deliver a much more accessible "general-purpose" Microprocessor that
contains Supercomputing elements and consequently stands a much more
realistic chance of general world-wide adoption (including Europe).


An additional insight: OpenRISC 1200 took 12 years to reach maturity.
The team developed the entire processor architecture, low-level software
and compiler technology, entirely from scratch.  We considered this
approach and, due to the long timescales, rejected it, choosing
instead to leverage and be compatible with a pre-existing Open ISA:
OpenPOWER. We also considered RISC-V however it turns out to be too
simplistic (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24459041) and it is
far too late to retrospectively add Supercomputer-grade power-efficient
functionality to its design or instruction set.  With the IBM-inspired
Power ISA already being a Supercomputer-grade ISA, it is a natural fit for
an energy-efficient Cray-style Vector upgrade, and comes with 25 years
of pre-existing software, libraries, compilers and customers.  By being
backwards-compatible with the existing Power ISA 3.0 (which is now an
Open ISA managed by the OpenPOWER Foundation), European businesses will
benefit from that pre-existing decades-established stability and pedigree.


As hinted at, above: Great hardware is nothing without the corresponding
compiler technology and support libraries. Consequently we need to engage
with Compiler Service Companies (Embecosm Gmbh, Vrull.eu) to evaluate the
feasibility of adding Vectorisation support to gcc, llvm and low-level
standard libraries. Whilst Libre-SOC has already demonstrated TRL (3)
successful assembly-level SVP64 algorithms (MP3 CODEC in particular),
assembler is far too low-level for general-purpose compute. C, C++
and other programming language support is required to be evaluated
and developed.  Also given that the Libre-SOC Core is being long-term
designed for energy-efficient 3D GPU and Video Processing workloads,
two 3D Vulkan Drivers (Kazan and MESA3D) need to be taken beyond
proof-of-concept (TRL 2/3).


We consider it strategically critical to develop processors in an entirely
transparent fashion. The current Silicon Industry chooses secrecy to mask
technology shortcuts and restrictive cross licencing, which inevitably and
systematically fails to provide trustable hardware: Intel's Management
Engine; Qualcomm making 40% of the world's smartphones vulnerable to
hacking; Apple drive-by Zero-day Wireless exploits; Super-Micro being
delisted from NASDAQ for failing to be able to prove the provenance of
all hardware and software components.  We consider Libre / Open Hardware
ASICs and the full Libre/Open VLSI toolchain itself to be fundamental
to end-user trust and security as well as Digital Sovereignty.


In addition to this, Libre-SOC has already been developing Mathematical
Formal Correctness Proofs for the HDL of its early prototype designs,
which, in combination with unrestricted access to the HDL Source Code,
allow third parties including customers to perform their own verification
of the ASIC's purpose (as opposed to the customer having to trust a
manufacture that inherently has a direct conflict-of-interest in the form
of its Shareholders and profits).  Furthermore, we aim to experiment with
built-in "tamper-checking" circuits that, on running a test programme on
our evaluation test bed, will provide an Electro-Magnetic "signature".
By publishing this "signature" and the test programs, customers can
verify that their purchased ASICs have the same EMF "signature" and can
detect immediately if the ASIC has been tampered with.  In addition we
will continue existing (TRL 2) research into Hardware-level Speculative
Execution mitigation techniques.  We feel that the full combination of
these objectives meets the Hardware Security requirements of this Call.


This strategy does not end with just the HDL: thanks (again) to NLnet
we have been collaborating already with Chips4Makers, LIP6 and CNRS
(all funded by EU Grants), to advance the state-of-the-art for European
VLSI Tool Technology, which is important to European Silicon Sovereignty.


https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2020/651992/EPRS_BRI(2020)651992_EN.pdf


We are however significantly concerned that the LIP6 Department, as
an Academic body, is inevitably underfunded, particularly when it is the
sole provider of Libre/Open VLSI Silicon-proven software in the whole
of Europe. This is why we have included an Engineering Supplement for
LIP6 and CNRS in the Libre-SOC budget, to contract engineering support
for them and to avoid employment complications due to the French Civil
Service Regulations, which lack the flexibility needed.  These engineers,
who are in high demand, will work for Libre-SOC/RED Semiconductor Ltd
but be fully available to assist in the development work covered by the
grant being done by LIP6 and CNRS.


The consequential effect of this tool development will be to help
create VLSI tools that can be directly substituted for the existing
commercial (and geopolitically constrained) tools from companies such as
Cadence and Mentor, giving a Euro-centric independence from “technology
constraining” acts.


We are currently awaiting the return of our first 180 nm architecture
test ASIC (TRL 4) from TSMC, through IMEC.  It is the first major
silicon in Europe of its size (5.1 x 5.9 mm^2 and 130,000 cells)
to be entirely developed using a Libre-Licensed VLSI ASIC toolchain,
and the world's first Power ISA 3.0 outside of IBM to reach Silicon in
over 12 years. We have already started to push (drive) the evolution of
Europe's only silicon-proven Libre/Open VLSI toolchain, something this
Grant application will support and will allow LIP6 and CNRS to enhance
it to lower geometries and larger ASIC sizes which will be critical to
European businesses' Digital and Silicon Sovereignty.

 For the avoidance of confusion the use of the word "Cell" refers to a
bounded piece of electronic design that when used together, like bricks,
form larger more complicated electrical functions.

 To help advance Digital Sovereignty, LIP6 and CNRS need to once
again push the boundaries of the Libre/Open VLSI toolchain, coriolis2
Place-and-Route, https://coriolis2.lip6.fr and HITAS/YAGLE Static Timing
Analyser https://www-soc.lip6.fr/equipe-cian/logiciels/tasyagle/ both
of which are, at the lower 360 and 180 nm geometries, at TRL 9, but are
at TRL 2 for lower geometries 90, 65, 45 nm and below.


Chips4Makers (also NLnet funded) created FlexLib Libre/Open Cell
Libraries which allows porting of Standard Cell Libraries to any geometry.
An NDA'd TSMC 180nm version of FlexLib was created for the Libre-SOC
180nm test ASIC.  To achieve our objectives, LIP6 and CNRS will need to
create smaller geometry ports of FlexLib.  These Cell Libraries need to
be tested in actual Silicon, and consequently we will be working with
IMEC as a sub-contractor and partner to deliver MPW Shuttle Runs for
these critical Libraries, using Libre-SOC Cores as a "proving-ground".

In addition, NLnet, a Stichting / Foundation, has been so successful
in supporting "Works for the Public Good" that we feel that their approach
and service fulfilment are extremely relevant to this Call. During the
36 month duration of the proposal, NLnet is in a position to engage
with Libre/Open Hardware and Software developers which, for our team,
will mitigate the risk of unanticipated issues requiring specialist but
small-scope funding, that yet still meets the well-defined objectives
of this Call.

To put all of this to practical use, Helix Technologies, by defining
an advanced GPS Correlator, will set a Computational capability objective
for the core technology and be a Reference test-bed. Helix will then
be able to carry out the comparative studies which show that the core
technology meets significant performance/watt improvements. The ultimate
destination for some of these devices will be Satellites (Space).

Helix Technologies biography:

Helix develops antennas and electronic systems for PNT (Position,
Navigation, Timing) applications. Markets include defence/security,
asset tracking, autonomous systems/vehicles/drones/robotics, critical
infrastructure (network sync – 5G, V2X, etc), fintech (blockchain
timestamping) and many other industrial applications.

Helix solutions defend against the vulnerabilities and threats to
global dependency on GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems), where
disruption to services would cost the world’s major economies £10s
of Billions every single day. Our patented technology enables filtering
antennas to mitigate multi-path, RF and electrical interference and
reduce the impact of jamming and spoofing, meaning that the receiver
electronics becomes a streamlined high performance, low-power/low-cost
correlator/processor to deliver highly accurate and resilience x,y,z
and time data as its output. We are developing sophisticated anti-
jamming/spoofing hardware that uses targeted nulling to ignore jamming,
and enable system-level resilience. This capability can be co-designed
with the receiver chipset for ultimate resilience.

Summary of why our work is pertinent to Call HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-01:


* High-performance energy-efficient computing: SVP64 is a Cray-style Vector ISA. Cray-style Vector ISAs are known to produce smaller and more compact programs. Smaller programs means less L1 Cache misses, and overall, smaller L1 Caches are needed.  This results inherently in greatly-reduced power consumption, whilst also remaining practical and general-purpose programmable.
* Targeted applications: We are developing a general-purpose Hybrid Architecture suitable for 3D, Video, Digital Signal Processing, Cryptographic applications, AI and many more.  As it is general-purpose it covers all these areas.  However in certain areas "specialist" instructions are needed (particularly 3D) and we seek additional funding to complete them.  This includes Helix's high-accuracy GPS application which qualifies as a step-improvement in "Sensor fusion".
* Hardware-software co-design and Libre/Open Hardware-Software: as all participants are trained as Software Engineers, we inherently and automatically bring Software Engineering practices and techniques to Hardware design, and consequently achieve a far greater effectiveness and flexibility. Additionally, all participants are long-term contributors to Libre/Open Software and Hardware Projects. This shall continue throughout this Grant proposal.  The involvement of RED Semiconductor Ltd brings further semiconductor hardware experience, bringing balance to the overall team.
* Moore's Law and changing Economics: as a general-purpose Cray-style Vector Supercomputer ISA, what we are designing may deploy either "Fast and Narrow" back-end (internal) micro-architecture, or "Slow and Wide": huge numbers of SIMD ALUs running at a much slower clock rate.  The beauty and elegance of a Vector ISA is that, unlike SIMD ISAs such as AVX-512, NEON and to a partial extend SVE2, is that the programmer doesn't need to know about the internal micro-architecture, but their programs achieve the same throughput, even on larger geometries.
* Hardware-based security: We consider it deeply unwise to follow the false practice of "adding more complexity to achieve more security".  Security is achieved through simplicity and transparency.  Simplicity: we studied historic Supercomputer designs dating back to 1965 (CDC 6600) where pure pragmatism required simpler and more elegant designs.  Transparency: Fully Libre/Open designs that customers can themselves verify by running Formal Correctness Proofs (where those tools are also Libre/Open Source). Fully Libre/Open VLSI toolchains and Cell Libraries (no possibility of insertion of spying at the Silicon level). "Tripwires" embedded into the silicon to gauge area-local EMF "Signatures". Additionally, we already have work underway into Out-of-Order Execution and seek to explore Speculative Execution Mitigation techniques at the hardware level, to increase security. These are practical achievable demonstrable ways to achieve Hardware-based trust.
* Security and Safety-critical Guidelines: Due to our overall approach, although potentially inherently achievable by others utilising our work as the basis for ongoing Research, the main participants consider it out of scope due to practical time constraints.  Security Certification typically takes 5 to 7 years: The scope of this project is only 3.  NLnet however may fund work that does indeed take into account these criteria.
* ASIC (Chip) prototyping: We are developing RTL including High-Level (core designs) as well as Low-Level (Cell Libraries).  Nobody in any European Company will use a Cell Library if it has not been demonstrated as Silicon-Proven.  As we already did with the 180nm ASIC, the best way to prove that a Cell Library (and an innovative approach - using Libre/Open VLSI toolchains) works is to do an actual ASIC.


Additional notes:


1. With regard to "Improve by two orders of magnitude the performance/watt for targeted Edge Applications", subject to Moore's Law and other limitations, such as geometry of devices we are moving in this direction, and whether we can achieve it will be subject to the available manufacturing processes we can afford during the scope of this Grant.  We have already achieved one magnitude of improvement in simulation (TRL 3) of FFT, DCT and other DSP calculations. As already indicated above, the output of our design can be run on many different geometries of significantly-different performances.
2. You will note that a significant number of our technology collaborators and the technology and services that we rely on are already funded by EU Grants.  Through RED Semiconductor Ltd, we are going to be the conduit to commercial realisation of value for this investment, with subsequent commercial benefits of employment and tax revenues across the EU.  We know not to lose sight of the fact all EU funding is fundamentally focused on future commercial success.

##            1.2        Methodology


* Everything that Libre-SOC does is published as Libre/Open Information at https://libre-soc.org/ - source code (https://git.libre-soc.org)  is open and available under the LGPLv3+ License and other appropriate Libre/Open Licenses.
* LIP6 likewise discloses all source code at https://gitlab.lip6.fr/vlsi-eda
* LIP6's toolkit containing existing large-geometry Cell Libraries and test benches at https://gitlab.lip6.fr/vlsi-eda/alliance-check-toolkit.
* CNRS's HITAS/YAGLE is also Open Source https://www-soc.lip6.fr/equipe-cian/logiciels/tasyagle/.
* Symbiyosys and its subcomponents for Formal Correctness Proofs are Libre/Open https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/.
* GPS GNSS-SDR is also Open Source https://gnss-sdr.org/ and can be adapted for Helix's requirement
* Chips4Makers FlexLib is also Open Source https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers but the NDA'd "ports"  are not.
* To solve the above problem, all Libre/Open Developers will work with an Academic "Ghost" version, called C4M-FreePDK45 https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-freepdk45. This "ghost" version will allow full (parallel-track) collaboration between Libre/Open Developers and those Participants creating "real" GDS-II Files, without violating Foundry NDAs.


This methodology is based on an established process that has already
allowed us to deliver demonstrable software and hardware results,
the manifestation of which is our 180nm architecture test chip now
in manufacture.  This has involved a significant amount of cooperative
development among the applicants, and others beyond, and the development
of core supporting technology that this grant application can now
efficiently build upon.


We refer to other supporting technology sources further in this
application and whilst they are not the core team they will critically
contribute to the overall success.  In particular, these groups can be
supported by NLnet, whose "Works for the Public Good" remit is 100%
compatible with the full transparency objectives (that the project's
participants are already committed to) which will help by providing
additional non-core-team development on an on-demand basis, on the back
of NLnet's already-trusted commitment to fulfil European Union objectives
under Grant Agreements No 825310 and 825322.


Additionally, Libre-SOC is working closely with the OpenPOWER Foundation
ISA Working Group Chair, having attended regular bi-weekly meetings for
over 18 months. As mentioned above, the entirety of our work of greater
than 3 years on this Vector Extension, SVP64, is entirely transparent
and open: https://libre-soc.org/openpower/sv/svp64/.  Both NLnet
(and StandICT.eu through a proposal under consideration at the time of
writing) are supporting our efforts to submit the Draft SVP64 and its
subcomponents through the RFC (Request for Change) process being developed
by the OpenPOWER Foundation.  For long-term stability and impact it is a
necessary prerequisite that Draft SVP64 become an official part of the
Power ISA: this decision is however down to the OpenPOWER Foundation
and requires considerable preparation and planning, which this Grant
will help support.


One huge benefit of Libre-SOC's core being Power ISA 3.0 Compliant is that
IBM contributed a huge patent pool through the OpenPOWER EULA. Compliant
Designs enjoy the protection of this patent pool.  By contributing SVP64
to the Power ISA it falls under this same umbrella.  Libre-SOC shall be
entering into an agreement with the OpenPOWER Foundation, here, as part
of the ISA RFC process.  European businesses clearly benefit from the
long-term stability of this arrangement.


Whilst we clearly need, ultimately, to prove our design's power-efficiency
in silicon, we would however consider it unwise and extremely costly to
tape-out to Silicon without having gone through a proper early-evaluation
process, weeding out ineffective strategies and designs.  To that end, we
learned from Jeff Bush's work on the Nyuzi 3D core to perform estimates
on power consumption and clock cycles.  This is a highly-effective
feedback process that allows identification and targeting of the most
urgent (inefficient) areas, and we have taken it on-board and adopted
it throughout the project.


Part of that involves Peter Hsu's cavatools (another NLnet Grant) which
is (at present) a cycle-accurate Simulator for RISC-V.  A (new) NLnet
Grant (not yet approved at the time of writing) is targeted at porting
cavatools to the Power ISA. This proposal would allow NLnet-funded work to
be extended into 3D, Video, DSP and other areas, to simulate (test) out
the feasibility, power-efficiency and effectiveness of different Custom
SVP64 Extensions to the Power ISA, long before they reach actual Silicon.


#           2 Impact


##         2.1 Project’s pathways towards impact


The core of modern computing is the capability of the computational
element of the systems and the microprocessors they are based around.
Every twenty years there has been a significant evolutionary step in the
technical concepts employed by these microprocessor devices.  For example
the last big step was the concept of RISC (Reduced Instruction Set)
processors.  These developments have been driven by many forces from
cost of devices to limitations of the available technology of the time.


The Libre-SOC core is capable of becoming the next significant step
change in microprocessor speed, technology, and reduction in equivalent
computational power (Watts).


To illustrate this, we need to go back in history to early computing.
The first microprocessors were reliant on expensive core then bipolar
memory and even with the advent of DRAMS (Dynamic Random-Access Memories)
the primary focus of microprocessor processor core designs was to
optimise the minimal use of memory and focus on the power of the core.
Over time, memory became cheaper and reliance on memory to improve
processing increased with techniques like RAMdisk stores were developed.
This cheap memory also resulted in the evolution of RISC and similar
computing technology concepts.  Today the problem is epitomized by speed,
where microprocessors have evolved to be much faster than the fastest
memories, and to increase performance, the state of the art computing
requires coming full-circle: once again minimising the use of memory,
which is now a log jam, and looking again at the core optimisation
solutions devised in the 1960’s by luminaries such as Seymour Cray.
The Libre-SOC core is an optimal adoption of this category of core
processor performance enhancement.


Libre-SOC has the benefit that its development relies on fundamental
research that has been known and proven for nearly 60 years.  SVP64 has
input from and takes on-board lessons learned from NEC SX-Aurora, Cray-I,
Mitch Alsup's MyISA 66000, RISC-V RVV Vectors, MRISC32, AVX-512, ARM
SVE2, Qualcomm Hexagon and TI's DSP range, as well as other more esoteric
Micro-architectures such as Aspex's Array-String Processor and Elixent's
2D Grid design.


As a Hybrid (merged) CPU-VPU-GPU Micro-architecture (similar to
ICubeCorp's IC3128) there is a huge reduction in the complexity
of 3D Graphics and Video Driver and overall hardware.  NVidia, ARM
(MALI), AMD, PowerVR, Vivante: these are all dual (ISA-incompatible)
architectures with staggering levels of hardware-software complexity.
Like ICubeCorp's design, Libre-SOC 3D and Video binaries are executed
directly on the actual main (one) core.


The end-result here is, if deployed in mass-volume products world-wide
including for European end-users of ubiquitous Computing devices, a
significant energy saving results on a massive scale, particularly in
battery-operated (mobile, tablet, laptop) appliances.  Demonstrating this
however requires, ultimately, that we actually create real silicon,
and measure its performance and power consumption.


##         2.2        Measures to maximise impact - Dissemination,
exploitation and communication


As the Libre-SOC core is the result of a Libre/Open Source project
by default all of our development work has been published for the last
four years.  This was also a requirement of our EU funding through NLnet.
In addition we have undertaken a full program of conference presentations,
technology awareness activities and cooperation with key bodies such as
the OpenPOWER Foundation and OpenPOWER Members (Libre-SOC is participating
in a world-wide Open University Course about the OpenPOWER ISA, an
activity led by IBM). Examples:


* https://openpowerfoundation.org/events/openpower-summit-2020-north-america/
* https://openpowerfoundation.org/libre-soc-180nm-power-isa-asic-submitted-to-imec-for-fabrication/


Marie-Minerve Louerat (CNRS) and Jean-Paul Chaput's and Professor
Galayko's (Sorbonne Université LIP6 Lab) Academic Publications will

Luke Leighton also releases videos of his Libre-SOC talks on
youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/lkcl and a full list of all
conferences (past and present) are maintained on the Libre-SOC website

The Libre-SOC bugtracker (where we track our TODO actions) is
public access (https://bugs.libre-soc.org), and the Mailing
lists are also public access (https://lists.libre-soc.org).
LIP6's alliance/coriolis2 mailing lists are also public access
(https://www-soc.lip6.fr/wws/info/alliance-users)


These are ongoing activities that actively encourage world-wide Open
Participation, and shall remain so indefinitely.  We will continue to
grow these activities along with a commercial thread of publicity by RED
Semiconductor Ltd to publicise and determine product family opportunities
where RED Semiconductor Ltd will focus on potential product and market
development built upon the Libre-SOC core technology.


##       2.3 Summary


### Specific needs


Modern computing technology is designed in secrecy and released to
the market without the ability of the user base to vet or validate.
When problems arise it is usually due to “discovery” and usually
driven by technical curiosity or malice.  What is clear is that to those
on the inside these problems were visible from the outset, however
time resource and unwillingness to explore (and unethical Commercial
pragmatism) has left these vulnerabilities open to be exploited.  As a
general principle we have taken the view that any new design should be
open to review and able to be corrected (every design has some bugs)
before mass adoption and the inevitable loss and crisis.


In practical terms: as indicated in sections above there have
been a number of security incidents involving ubiquitous computing
devices, impacting millions to hundreds of millions of end-users,
world-wide. Qualcomm failed last year to provide adequate secure firmware,
leaving 40% of the entire world's Android smartphones vulnerable to
attack. With the majority of smartphones being "fire-and-forget" products
with non-upgradeable firmware, the end-user's only solution is to throw
away a perfectly good electronics product and purchase a new one.
For Intel products - all Intel products - the exact same thing has
occurred (Master Firmware Key, Spectre, Meltdown), but at an unfixable
hardware level, and there are no replacement Intel products that can be
purchased in the market to "fix" their fundamental design flaws.


Not only that, but all of the ubiquitous Computing products (Apple, Intel,
IBM, NVidia, AMD being the most well-known) are 100% non-EU-based.  As far
as EU Digital Sovereignty is concerned, this is an extremely serious
and alarming situation, compounded by critical Foundries and know-how
to run those Foundries also not being part of a Sovereign European remit.


If that was not enough, Foundries and the Semiconductor Industry requires
NDAs that at the minimum prohibit full publication of Academic results,
stifling innovation and research, in turn driving up the cost for EU
businesses of the cost of ASIC products by creating artificial cost,
overhead and knowledge barriers.


The entire Computing and Semiconductor Industry needs a new approach.


Taking the initiative, the end goal of the Libre-SOC/RED Semiconductor
Ltd project is therefore to deliver high performance, security auditable,
supercomputer class computing devices to the market.  As this is not
currently available it will prompt a step change in low power (Watts)
high performance computing. This will be achieved through:


* Energy/Power consumption measurement: we need to verify that performance/watt is lowered
* Draft SVP64 inclusion in Power ISA: this is needed to indicate "Official long-term Status"
* Auditability and Transparency: needed for end-users and EU businesses to trust the hardware.
* Power ISA 3.0 Interoperability: to leverage over 2 decades of existing business software tools.
* FPGA and Simulator demonstrators: to demonstrate feasibility of the HDL and the ISA
* VLSI toolchain and Cell Library: MPW Shuttle runs are needed to reach "Silicon-proven" status
* NLnet mini-grants: Effectively this is a "Reserve" budget for the Project, managed by NLnet


### Dissemination, exploitation and Communication

 Energy/Power consumption measurement:


Just as Jeff Bush showed by publishing Nyuzi Research at Conferences we
shall follow the same proven incremental performance/watt measures and
procedures, and publish the results.

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7095803/


Draft SVP64 inclusion in Power ISA:


We are already working with the OpenPOWER ISA Working Group, and have
already begun publishing the Draft SVP64 Specification as it is being
developed.  This will become official RFCs (Request for Changes) leading
to adoption.  This includes development of Compliance Test Suites,
low-level libraries, compilers etc. which shall be announced through
Conferences, Press Releases (by RED Semiconductor Ltd, NLnet and the
OpenPOWER Foundation) and standard Libre/Open development practices
(Mailing list Announcements).


Auditability and Transparency:


Using symbiyosys we have already established a number of Formal
Correctness Proofs for the TRL 3 HDL used in the 180nm ASIC: This
needs to be extended right the way throughout all future work and be
published for other OpenPOWER Foundation Members and European businesses
to be able to independently verify the correct functionality of not just
Libre-SOC ASIC designs but other Power ISA 3.0 compliant designs as well.
Libre-SOC HDL and the associated Formal Correctness Proofs are published
as-they-are-developed in real-time and consequently dissemination is
implicit and automatic.


For the Silicon-level "EMF signature" measurement system Libre-SOC
will define and publish Reference Standards, test applications and
methodology documentation.  RED Semiconductor Ltd will establish
and make available a "expected results" database for its commercial
products, as part of its Product Application Documentation, so that
European Businesses may independently verify that their commercial
off-the-shelf RED Semiconductor Ltd products have not been tampered with
at the Silicon level.  (It is beyond the scope of this Grant however RED
Semiconductor Ltd will publish its overall Quality Standards Strategy).
In concept, the "EMF Signature" strategy is very similar to Hewlett
Packard's "Signature Analysis Strategy" that has been around since
1949. https://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1977-05.pdf


Power ISA 3.0 Interoperability:


Standing on the shoulders of Giants (IBM and other OPF Members in
this case) is always a good starting point.  The familiarity and
decades-long-term stability of the existing Power ISA 3.0 gives us a vast
existing-established user audience to whom we can provide training and
experience upgrades from an existing high-level of knowledge.  In this
we already have the cooperation of IBM (through the OpenPOWER University
Education Course that Libre-SOC has helped to create - to be first run
from 18th-29th October 2021).


We will take the Interoperability further at a practical level
by developing a Libre/Open Power ISA 3.0 "Compliance Test
Suite" that meets the OpenPOWER Foundation documented standards
(https://openpowerfoundation.org/openpower-isa-compliance-definition/)
and make it entirely public and available to all without limit, and invite
other OpenPOWER Foundation Members to participate in its development
and use.  This will then be, again, announced through Press Releases
and Mailing List as well as Conference Presentations.


FPGA and Simulator demonstrators:


Again: all new software tools created, and existing ones used and modified
to both develop and use resultant devices will be published as an inherent
part of the OpenSource real time publishing strategy.


VLSI Toolchain and Cell Library verification:


Again: the results of the development are, to date and in the future,
part of Libre/Open Source projects, and are therefore fully-visible, even
though they are Hardware-related we treat them as Open Source Software.
Conference presentations shall therefore be given, announcements on
Mailing Lists, as part of the overall communications strategy.


In this particular case however, the communication has to involve the
results of the MPW Shuttle runs, testing the actual ASICs, because it
is critical to demonstrate and communicate that the Cell Libraries are
Silicon-Proven and that the VLSI tools were capable of successfully
creating that Silicon-Proven layout.  However the caveat here: anything
involving NDA'd material as required by the Foundry has to remain
confidential (note that this is not something that can be addressed
within the funding scope of this Call)


NLnet mini-grants:


NLnet's website has already been established with communication facilities
for around 19 years.  NLnet are experienced in the effective evaluation
and management of small-scale Grants.  They are also extremely familiar
with the work that we are doing, and with the detail of EU Grant
Procedures. Following those procedures they will add a new section to
the website for Grant Proposals that inherently meet the objectives of
this Call, and will use their existing communications infrastructure to
maximum benefit.


### Expected results


Energy/Power consumption measurement:


We anticipate in the actual ASIC a significant measurable reduction in
performance/watt.  Early predictions shall be based on Instruction-level
Simulations, but these need to be validated against the "real thing".
Due to the iterative process (outlined by Jeff Bush) we simply cannot
state exactly in advance the full magnitude of improvement that will
occur. The process itself, and how it was successfully applied, however,
will be considered to be part of the results themselves as part of
publications online and at Conferences.


Draft SVP64 inclusion in Power ISA:


The ultimate outcome here is that SVP64 becomes an officially-adopted
part of the OpenPOWER ISA, including a full compliance test suite,
documentation in a future revision of the official Power ISA Technical
Reference Manual.  This process is, however, by necessity and being an
extremely important responsibility of the OpenPOWER Foundation (not of
any of the Participants), very slow and outside of our control, and may
take longer than the 36 month duration of the Grant to complete.


Therefore, the critical Milestone shall be our submission to the
OpenPOWER Foundation's ISA Working Group, as well as the development of
the required Compliance Test Suites.  Both of these shall be published
under appropriate Libre/Open Licenses.


Auditability and Transparency:


We will have completed the Formal Correctness Proofs and published them
and the results of running them against the Libre-SOC HDL.   We will also
have received the ASICs back from MPW Shuttle runs, which will contain
"EMF detection" wires routed strategically throughout it, and run the
pre-arranged unit tests that will create "Signatures" that shall be
recorded and published.  This task is another critical reason why we
need actual Silicon, because only with an ASIC can we demonstrate the
viability of Signature Analysis (and similar) Strategies for ASICs.


Power ISA 3.0 Interoperability:


We will have completed an implementation of the Compliance Test
Suite as a Libre-Licensed application that can test multiple different
implementations: FPGA, Simulators (including our own as well as qemu), and
actual Silicon implementations including IBM POWER9, POWER10, Microwatt.
In addition we will have extended our own interoperability "Test API"
that allows comparisons of any arbitrary user-generated application
against any other arbitrary Power ISA compliant devices (whether FPGA,
Simulator, or Silicon): the OpenPOWER Compliance Test Suite implementation
shall simply be one of those applications.


We expect the Libre-SOC core to pass the full OpenPOWER ISA 3.0 Test
Suite, and the results to be published.  We will also communicate with
OpenPOWER Foundation Members and make them aware of the existence of
the Test Suite and document how it may be used to test their own Power
ISA 3.0 implementations for Compliance.


FPGA and Simulator demonstrators:


Successful software simulation (emulation) of the augmented Power 3.0 ISA
with the Draft SVP64 Extensions, and successful demonstration of the HDL
of a multi-core SMP processor implementing the same, running in a large
FPGA (the size of the commercially-available FPGAs constraining what
is possible, here).  Each shall help verify the other's correctness.
This will be a rapid iterative cycle of development and shall always
produce early results, feeding back to continued improvement.


VLSI Toolchain and Cell Library verification:


Multiple demonstrator 2-core ASICs and a proven path to an 8-core ASIC
(as we anticipate that the 8-core is likely to be beyond the scope of the
Grant due to Silicon costs).  Where the 2-core ASIC MPW is multi-purpose
(proving the HDL, proving the VLSI toolchain, proving the Cell Library)
and shall use the FPGA and Simulations to check its correctness before
proceeding, the 8-core shall remain in FPGA only, due to cost, but a
VLSI Layout for the 8-core will still be attempted, in order to "test
the limits" of the VLSI tools.  If funding was available we could take
the 8-core to full MPW rather than just to FPGA and GDS-II.  As the 8
core Layout develops, if it (and the coriolis2 toolchain)  progresses
to viability in the 36 months one option might be for RED Semiconductor
to apply for a EUR 500,000 NLnet mini-grant, payment terms to meet
requirements set by IMEC, from their budget allocated under this proposal.


NLnet mini-grants:


NLnet will receive and review potentially hundreds of small Grant
Proposals to ensure that they meet both the Call's Objectives and meet
NLnet's responsibilities as a Stichting / Foundation to fund "Works
for the Public Good".  They shall request that the successful Grant
Applicant create Milestones and that Grant Applicant communicate those
results, thus requiring that it is the Grant Applicant that fulfils the
requirement herein.  This process is already established and already in
effect under Grant Agreements No 825310 and 825322.


In the case of the Participants, if we need "reserve" budgets for
unforseen activities, we commit to following that exact same procedure
and thus also shall meet the Objectives of this Call (examples include
the MPW 8-core, above).  We are aware that new technology beneficial to
the project may not be currently apparent but will be available within
the 36 months duration, and the methodology of funding it through NLnet
may prove optimal and a cost-effective use of EU funds, as NLnet would
(as they do now) only draw the budget down as needed.


### Target groups


Due to our Open real time publishing of the Libre-SOC project, our work
can be forked by anyone at any time as a starting point or as a building
block for new projects, potentially taking the ideas and concepts in any
direction.  These can be individuals or teams and they can be academics
or industrialists, the point being that if we trigger a step change in
the technology everyone should be able to benefit.


This is in addition to our own commercialisation plans.


Open Source methodology leads to Open standards which leads to Open
understanding and rapid adoption of new ideas in academia and industry.
The Eurocentric nature and benefit of the work should not be overlooked
either.


### Outcomes


As the development chain includes elements of commercialisation, beyond
the immediate benefit to similar projects by the enhancement of the
Libre/Open Source tool chain and the educational uplift provided directly
and by example to other groups and European businesses and Educational
Establishments planning Software-to-Silicon projects, the most direct
outcome will be the availability, as devices in the market through RED
Semiconductor Ltd, of a new concept in supercomputing power that is also
completely security auditable and transparent.


We are already aware of a commercial venture formed recently, who are
aware and already benefiting from our work over the last three years to
improve the Software-to-Silicon toolchain, that is now focusing on the
finessing of the toolchain and its human interface to widen access to the
methodology and IMEC are using our architectural test chip, currently in
production, to validate and test their new cloud based chip design suite.
The outcomes are already happening and are bound to magnify.


### Impacts


We believe the market demand for our step change in core architecture
thinking is so great it will force the world's leading microprocessor
companies to follow.  The result will be a greater step change in the
performance and security of computer hardware across the world.


Additionally the confirmation of Silicon-proven Cell Libraries and
a European-led functional Libre-Licensed VLSI toolchain in lower
geometries will significantly reduce the cost of ASIC development for
European businesses and reduce to zero the risk of critical dependence
on non-Sovereign (geo-politically constrained) Commercial VLSI tools
and Cell Libraries.

Objectives:


To manage the people who put in supplementary (by timescale) proposals
intended to support the core objectives of our proposal, ensuring that
those proposals also honour and meet the objectives outlined in the
original call:

https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl4-2021-digital-emerging-01-01


This will allow us to address and deploy new ideas and concepts not
immediately available to us at the time of this submission, and have
them properly vetted by an Organisation both familiar with our work,
and already trusted by the EU to fulfil the same role for other EU Grants.


Description of work:


These descriptions effectively mirror the light-weight grant mechanism
NLnet manages for the NGI research and development calls (EU Grants
825310 and 825322) and does not deviate from those pre-established
procedures except to define the context of the work to be carried out
by the Grant Recipient to fall within the criteria defined by this call
(HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-01) not those of the previous Grants


* To include on the NLnet website a dedicated Call for mini-grant (EUR 50,000) Proposals, meeting the criteria of this existing Call (HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-01) where the wording shall be written by NLnet and approved by the EU.
* To analyse and vet the Proposals to ensure that they match the criteria, through a multi-stage process including validating appropriateness to the Libre-SOC Project and running each application through an Independent Review by the EU.
* To notify successful Applicants, to ensure that they sign a Memorandum of Understanding with attached pre-agreed Milestones, and to fulfil Requests for Payment on 100% successful completion of those same pre-agreed Milestones.
* To produce Audit and Transparency Reports and to engage the services of Auditors to ensure compliance.


Deliverables:


Again these deliverables are no different from NLnet's existing
deliverables to the EU under Grant Agreements  825310 and 825322


* 1.1. A functioning Call-for-Proposals on the NLnet website.
* 1.2. Inclusion of the new CfP within the existing NLnet infrastructure
* 1.3. Progress Reports and Independent Audit Reports to the EU


## 2. SVP64 Standards, RFC submission to OPF ISA WG


Table 3.1b(2)


|Work Package Number                |2                                                        |

Objectives:


To advance Draft SVP64 Standards, to work with the OpenPOWER Foundation
ISA Working Group to comply with deliverable requirements as defined
by the OPF ISA WG within their Request For Change (RFC) Process, and to
deliver them.


Description of work:


* Extend Draft SVP64 into other areas necessary for fulfilment of this Call (including Zero-Overhead Loop Control)
* Prepare SVP64 Standards Documentation for RFC Submission, including identifying appropriate subdivisions of work.
* Create presentations and explanatory material for OpenPOWER Foundation ISA WG Members to help with their Review Process
* Complete OPF ISA WG RFC submission requirements and submit the RFCs (Note: Compliance Test Suites are also required but are part of Work Package 3)
* Publish the results of the decision by the ISA WG (whether accepted or not) and adapt to feedback if necessary
* Repeat for all portions of all SVP64 Standards.


Deliverables:


Note: some of these deliverables may not yet be determined due to
the OpenPOWER Foundation having not yet finalised and published its
procedures, having not yet completed their Legal Review.  In addition,
although we can advise and consult with them, it will be the OPF ISA
WG who decides what final subdivisions of SVP64 are appropriate (not
the Participants). This directly impacts and determines what the actual
Deliverables will be: They will however fit the following template:


* 2.1. Publish report on appropriate subdivisions of SVP64 subdivisions into multiple distinct OPF RFCs
* 2.2. Publish presentations and explanatory materials to aid in the understanding of SVP64 and its value
* 2.3. Attend Conferences to promote SVP64 and its benefits
* 2.4. Complete the documentation and all tasks required for each SVP64 RFC and submit them to the OPF
* 2.5. For each RFC, publish a report on the decision and all other permitted information that does not fall within the Commercial Confidentiality Requirements set by the OpenPOWER Foundation (these conditions are outside of our control).

Objectives:


To advance the state-of-the-art in high-speed (near-real-time)
hardware-cycle-accurate ISA Simulators to include the Power ISA and the
SVP64 Draft Vector Extensions, and to create Test Suites and Compliance
Test Suites with a view to aiding and assisting OpenPOWER Foundation
Members including other European businesses and Academic Institutions
to be able to check the interoperability and compliance of their Power
ISA designs, and to have a stable base from which to accurately and
cost-effectively test out experimental energy-efficient and performance
advancements in computing, in close to real-time, before committing to
actual Silicon.


Description of work:


1. Supplement the work under NLnet "Assure" Grant No 2021-08-071 (part of EU Grant no 957073) to further advance a cavatools port to the Power ISA 3 with newer Draft SVP64 features not already covered by NLnet 2021-08-071 (Note: this particular NLnet Grant has not yet been approved at the time of writing)
2. Advancement of the Hardware-Cycle-Accuracy for Out-of-Order Execution simulation in cavatools, and the addition of other appropriate Hardware models.
3. Addition of other relevant Libre-SOC Draft Power ISA Extensions in cavatools for 3D, Video, Cryptography and other relevant Extensions.
4. Advancement of the Libre-SOC (TRL 3/4) "Test API" to other Simulators, HDL Simulators and existing ASICs (IBM POWER 9/10) and designs (Microwatt)
5. Implement Compliance Test Suite suitable for Libre-SOC according to OpenPOWER Foundation requirements (for Work Package 2: SVP64 Standards)
6. Develop an SVP64 Compliance Test Suite suitable for submission to the relevant OpenPOWER Workgroup, to a level that meets their requirements.


Deliverables:


* 3.1. Delivery of an updated version of cavatools with new Draft SVP64 features
* 3.2. Delivery of a version of cavatools with hardware-accurate models including Out-of-Order Execution
* 3.3. Delivery of additional co-simulation and co-execution options to the Libre-SOC "Test API" including at least IBM POWER 9 (and POWER 10 if access can be obtained), and Microwatt.
* 3.4. Delivery of an implementation of a Compliance Test Suite that meets the OpenPOWER Foundation's criteria
* 3.5. Delivery of the documentation and an implementation of a Compliance Test Suite for Draft SVP64 Extensions for submission to the relevant OpenPOWER Foundation Workgroup.
* 3.6. Public reports on all of the above at Conferences and on the Libre-SOC website.

Objectives:


To improve coriolis2 for lower geometries (to be decided on evaluation)
such that it performs 100% DRC-clean (Design Rule Check) GDS-II files
at the chosen geometry for the chosen Foundry, for each ASIC.


Note: Commercial "DRC" will confirm that the GDS-II layout meets timing,
electrical characteristics, ESD, spacing between tracks, sizes of vias
etc. and confirms that the layout will not damage the Foundry's equipment
during Manufacture.


Description of work:


Please Note: Work Packages 7, 8 and 9 are highly interdependent and
will cross fertilise their results in an iterative manner as the design
complexity increases, starting from smaller rapid-prototype test ASIC
layouts and progressing to full designs.


* The main focus (absolute priority) should be put on timing closure
    that becomes critical in the lower nodes. And if we can only achieve
    this alone, it will be a great success. That entails:
    - Improve the clock tree (change from H-Tree to a dynamically
      balanced one).
    - Improve High Fanout Net Synthesis.
    - Prevent hold violations.
    - Resizing of the gates (adjust power).
    - Logical resynthesis along the critical path, if needed.
    - Add a whole timing graph infrastructure.
*  To be able to implement those features has deep consequences on P&R:
    - We must have an "estimator" of the timing in the wires
      (first guess: Elmore).
    - The placer algorithm SimPL needs to be upgraded/rewritten
      to take on more additional constraints (adding and resizing
      gates on the fly).
* Better power supply. Control of IR-drop.
* Protection against cross-coupling.
* During all that process, we must work on a stable database.
    So correct speed bottleneck only in algorithms built upon it,
    not the DB itself. For this kind of design, it is acceptable
    to run a full day on a high end computer.
* Start a parallel project about to redesign the database (providing a backward
    compatibility API to Hurricane).  But we must not make depend the timing closure
    on the database Rewrite.


Deliverables:


The key deliverables are measured by the successful passing of DRC
(Design Rule Checks) against Commercial VLSI tools (Mentor, Synopsis), and
is so critically inter-dependent on all components working 100% together
that there can only be one deliverable, here, per ASIC Layout. Completion
of sub- and sub-sub-tasks shall however be recorded in an easily-auditable
Standard Libre/Open Task Tracking Database (gitlab, bugzilla) and
appropriate structured progress reports created.  As is the case with
all Libre/Open Projects, "continuous" delivery is inherent through the
ongoing publication of all source code in real-time. Full delivery is
expected around 30 months.

Objectives:


To create 100% DRC-clean VLSI Layouts, to perform the necessary
Validation of HDL as to its correctness at the transistor level, to
submit them for MPW Shuttle Runs at the appropriate geometry through IMEC,
and to test the resultant ASICs.  This to confirm that the advancements
to the entire coriolis2 VLSI Toolchain is in fact capable of correctly
producing ASICs at both smaller geometries than it can already do,
and at much larger sizes than it can already handle. To publish reports
that serve to inform European Businesses and Academic Institutions of
the results such that, if successful, those Businesses will potentially
save hugely on the cost of development of ASICs, and the dependence
on geo-political commercial tools is mitigated and the EU's Digital
Sovereignty Objectives met.


Description of work:


Please Note: Work Packages 7, 8 and 9 are highly interdependent and
will cross fertilise their results in an iterative manner as the design
complexity increases, starting from smaller rapid-prototype test ASIC
layouts and progressing to full designs.


* To create VLSI Layouts using Libre-SOC HDL
* To prepare and submit GDS-II Files to IMEC under appropriate MPW Shuttle Runs
* To develop a Test jig, including custom test socket and supporting test software for each ASIC and to produce an appropriate report
* To publish Academic Papers and other materials, on websites and at Conferences, on the results of each Tape-out.

training of new individuals introduced within each team.  Each individual
organisation will be responsible for their own activities with a central
focus being maintained by RED Semiconductor Ltd and Libre-SOC jointly.

Objectives:


To focus the Libre-SOC 2-core ASIC onto a real-word customer
requirement: GPS. To integrate both an FPGA as an early prototype and
the final ASIC into a Demonstrator connecting to Helix's high-accuracy
GPS Antenna Arrays. To confirm functionality, and confirm energy savings
(performance/watt) compared to other solutions.

This programme will enable Helix to research, specify and ultimately
realise, test and deploy a PNT processor single-chip that enables
encrypted millimetre precision GNSS position and &lt;nanosecond time data
to be delivered from today’s GNSS constellations, and to be ready for
next generation LEO (low earth orbit) PNT constellations being planned.

Helix’s comprehensive anti-jamming/spoofing and self-correcting
capabilities will be designed into the same chip, enabling single-die
total solution to accurate/resilient PNT, allowing Helix to integrate
the electronics functionality into its antennas to create an ultra-
compact ultra-low-power PNT solution that can be utilised globally
in the next wave of applications like autonomous vehicles, urban air
mobility, micro-transportation, and critical communications network
synchronisation where market size runs into the tens or hundreds of
million units per year.

Description of work:


1. Scoping Report by Helix to research a Technical Architecture and the full Mathematical Requirements
2. Creating from Scoping an agreed definition of the GPS ASIC requirement, by Helix, to be given to Libre-SOC and RED.
3. Software, Hardware, Documentation, FPGA Prototypes, Test and QA for the Libre-SOC 2-core to be focussed on GPS as a real-word customer Application.
4. Software Development and Hardware compatibility design through the GPS Antenna Arrays, and testing to confirm functionality in both FPGA and ASIC. To confirm reduction in performance/watt of the ASIC.
5. Reporting


Deliverables:


* 11.1 Scoping Report
* 11.2 NRE: Adapt 2-core to working demonstrator GPS Application
* 11.3 Helix Management of NRE
* 11.4 Helix Internal Engineering for GPS Antenna connectivity and testing.
* 11.5 Reports

(1) These software and compiler costs are to develop extremely specialist
software, where it is Industry-standard normal to spend EUR 25 million
to achieve TRL (9).  Contracting of an extremely small pool of specialist
Companies (Embecosm Gmbh, Vrull.EU) is therefore Industry-standard normal
practice.  All of the Compiler / Software Contracting shall be with
Companies that are part of the European Union.

(2) IMEC is one of Europe's leading Sub-contractors for ASIC MPW Shuttle
runs, and they handle the NDA relationships with Foundries that are almost
impossible to otherwise establish.

#        3.2        Capacity of participants and consortium as a whole


The majority of the consortium have been working together for over
three years on the precursor technical development of the Libre-SOC core
project,  the evolution of which is the lynch-pin and "proving-ground"
of this grant application.  The public record of their achievements
and team involvement can be found in their public Open Source record
https://libre-soc.org/.

The Libre-SOC team are internationally experienced software professionals
who have strong familiarity with state of the art software to silicon
technologies.  They have been supported by two of the co-applicants labs
CNRS and LIP6 (The applicants being Sorbonne Université and Affiliated
Entity, CNRS), and many other European based technology development
groups, which each provide key elements of the project from specialist
programs such as coriolis2, alliance, HITAS, YAGLE and more, and the
manufacturing expertise of Imec. Their versatility and experience with
Libre/Open Source Software also means that they can adapt to unforeseen
circumstances and can navigate the ever-changing and constantly-evolving
FOSS landscape with confidence.

The above is critically important in light of the requirement to
demonstrate access to critical infrastructure, resources and the
ability to fulfil: with the sole exception of NDA'd Foundry PDKs
(Physical Design Kits), the entirety of this project is Libre/Open
Source, both in the tools it utilises, components that it uses, and
the results that are generated.  With there being no restriction on
the availability of Libre/Open Source software needed to complete the
project, the Participants correspondingly have no impediment.  We also
have a proven strategy to deal with the NDA's: a "parallel track" where
at least one Participant (Sorbonne Université, LIP6 Lab) has signed
TSMC Foundry NDAs, and consequently there is no impediment there, either.

Sorbonne Université (SU) is a multidisciplinary, research-intensive
and world class academic institution. It was created on January 1st
2018 as the merger of two first-class research intensive universities,
UPMC (University Pierre and Marie Curie) and Paris-Sorbonne. Sorbonne
Université is now organized with three faculties: humanities, medicine
and science each with the wide-ranging autonomy necessary to conduct
its ambitious programs in both research and education. SU counts 53,500
students, 3,400 professor-researchers and 3,600 administrative and
technical staff members. SU is intensively engaged in European research
projects (163 FP7 projects and 195 H2020 projects).  Its computer
science laboratory, LIP6, is internationally recognized as a leading
research institute.

LIP6 is a Joint Research Unit of both SU (Sorbonne Université)
and CNRS. Both entities invest resources within LIP6 so CNRS is then
an Affiliated Entity linked to SU.  According to SU-CNRS agreement
regarding LIP6, SU, as a full partner, manages the grant for its
Affiliated Entity, CNRS.

RED Semiconductor Ltd has been established as a commercialisation vehicle,
sharing the Libre principles of the core Libre-SOC team and bringing
Semiconductor industry commercial management and technology experience.
This includes the founders of two successful semiconductor companies
and a public company chairman.  There is also a cross directorship of
Luke Leighton (of Libre-SOC) giving the company an extensive technology
market and leadership experience.

NLnet is a Netherlands based public benefit organisation that brings
to the table over 35 years of European internet history and well over
two decades of unique real-world experience in funding and supporting
bottom up internet infrastructure projects around the world - engaging
some of the best independent researchers and developers. NLnet has
funded essential work on important infrastructure parts of the internet,
from the technologies with which the answers from the DNS root of the
internet can now be trusted, all the way up to key standards for email
security, transport layer security, email authenticity, and a lot more
- on virtually every layer of the internet, from securing core routing
protocols to browser security plugins, from firmware security to open
source LTE networks.

Most recently NLnet is hosting the NGI0 Discovery, NGI0 PET and NGI
Assure open calls as part of the Next Generation Internet research and
development initiative, of which NLnet supports 300+ open source software,
open hardware and open standards projects to build a more resilient,
sustainable and trustworthy internet.

NLnet, a Stichting / Foundation, has been Libre-SOC’s funding source
from the beginning and fundamentally understands our technology and
direction of travel.  As well as providing augmentation under existing
EU Grants funding for technology opportunities that we will benefit from
but are yet to be identified, they are a fundamental sounding board that
will be invaluable to the project moving forward.

Regarding the extreme high-end computing resources necessary to complete
the exceptionally-demanding task of VLSI development and Layout, we
find that high-end modern laptops and desktop computers (with 64 to
256 GB of RAM) are perfectly adequate.  However in the event that our
immediately-accessible computing resources are not adequate, both Sorbonne
Université (LIP6 and CNRS) and Libre-SOC qualify for access to Fed4Fire
(https://www.fed4fire.eu/- grant agreement No 732638) which gives us
direct access to large clusters (100+) high-end servers.  Additionally,
we are specifying some of these high-end computers in our budget, and
the software to run on them is entirely Libre-Licensed and within our
combined experience to deploy.

We have established that Embecosm Gmbh and Vrull.eu are some of the
world's leading experts in Compiler Technology.  We will put out to
tender a Contract with an initial evaluation phase, followed by a TRL
4/5 Research phase for the prerequisite compilers (gcc, llvm, Kazan,
MESA3D) necessary to support the core design work.

The OpenPOWER Foundation is a part of the Linux Foundation,
and is directly responsible for the long-term protection
and evolution of the Power ISA.  Members include IBM, Google,
NVidia, Raptor Engineering, University of Oregon and many more.
https://openpowerfoundation.org/membership/current-members/.

The Chair of the newly-formed ISA Working Group is Paul Mackerras, and
the Technical Chair is Toshaan Bharvani.  Both of these people have
been kindly attending bi-weekly meetings with the Libre-SOC Team for
over 18 months, and we have kept them apprised of ongoing developments,
particularly with the Draft SVP64 ISA Extension.  They are both going
out of their way to regularly advise us on how to go about a successful
RFC Process for SVP64, and we deeply appreciate their support.

Helix Technology's involvement, as a potential customer and potential
user of the Libre-SOC technology, will give focus to the deliverable of
the project.  They have world-leading expertise in Antenna Technology,
and in the mathematics behind the Signal Processing required for
GNSS/GPS. We have deliberately selected them to ensure the ambition of
our overall project.

We therefore have a cohesive cooperative team of experience from concept
to customer product and a supporting cast of specialist technical support
that are an established practiced team.

As a last point: the creation of the teams for this project is critical
for RED Semiconductors Limited and Libre-SOC.  We have the benefit of
having the core of an International Technology Headhunter Research
Team amongst the directors of RED Semiconductor Limited, giving us
the capability to ensure the project is fully manned in the required
timescales without the need to externally resource recruitment services,
and this is included in RED’s management manpower.
