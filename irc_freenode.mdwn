# Using the Freenode IRC channel

use any IRC client, connect to the irc.freenode.net server and
join the #libre-soc channel.  you will need to register a nick
(instructions are online)

it is also useful to use an IRC "bouncer" - bnc4you provide one
for free to freenode users.

* join ##bnc4you
* send this message "-addznc {YOURIDENT} {YOURNICK}
* check DMs from an account b4u-Service
* create a new server connection back in your IRC client using the
  details received.  they will be something like
  freebnc.bnc4you.xyz/1234 {password}
